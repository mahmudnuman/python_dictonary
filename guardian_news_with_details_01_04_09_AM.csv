Security guards at Doha World Cup park claim they are paid just 35p an hour,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/nov/18/security-guards-doha-qatar-world-cup-park-claim-they-are-paid-just-35p-an-hour,"Migrant workers employed as security guards in a huge park that will be at the heart of Qatar’s World Cup festivities appear to be being paid as little as 35 pence an hour.The men are stationed across Al Bidda Park, a pristine green space adjoining the Fifa Fan Festival. Throughout the tournament Al Bidda Park will be packed with football fans enjoying the sweeping lawns, shaded picnic spots and views over Doha. The guards interviewed are not contracted to Fifa or deployed in the Festival.But long after fans have retreated to their hotels, the guards will stay on. In fact, it appears that fans are likely to see more of Doha in a week than these men will see in years. The guards say they work 12-hour shifts, and claim they usually get just one day off a month.“We just go between our duty and our accommodation,” said one holding out his phone. “You can show me anywhere in Qatar and I won’t know where it is.”The claims come on the eve of the start of the men’s Fifa World Cup, which is due to start on Sunday amid widespread international criticism of the host nation’s record on migrant worker and LGBTQ+ rights.In recent weeks Fifa and the Qatari authorities have battled to turn the spotlight away from workers’ and LGBTQ+ rights, with Fifa’s general secretary Gianni Infantino saying World Cup teams they should “focus on the football” and warning them against “handing out moral lessons to the rest of the world”. The Guardian’s findings are based on interviews carried out over the past few months with park guards working for Al Nasr Star Security Services. Guards and “marshals” employed by other companies also work in the park. There is no suggestion they are subject to the same claims over conditions.Analysis by The Guardian of workers’ pay notifications, corroborated by workers’ accounts of their working hours and pay, suggests that the guards are typically paid 1330 rials (£310) a month for 348 hours on duty, plus a small food allowance. It is understood that this includes 104 hours of overtime, for which they are paid 150 rials, which if correct equates to less than 35p an hour.Such working hours and overtime pay appear to be in breach of Qatar’s labour laws.The security guards say they know they are being underpaid but feel powerless to act. “It’s illegal, but the government keeps quiet, so what can we do?” claims one.“We put up with it because we need the money,” said another, revealing the predicament faced by many low-wage workers in Qatar. Others are grateful to at least have a job that pays more than they can make at home. “I’m happy because I get something … It’s a struggle but I don’t care because I don’t have anything,” one said.An Amnesty International report in March this year found exploitation in the private security sector was commonplace in Qatar.“Security guards are integral to the smooth running of the World Cup … No one should have to work under these conditions and anyone who has suffered abuse must be provided redress,” said Ella Knight, researcher on migrants’ labour rights at Amnesty.Knight suggested the Guardian’s findings are, “another clear example of the shortcomings of the reform process and how remaining gaps in enforcement of laws continue to afflict the lives of migrant workers in the country.”Qatar’s labour reforms should mean the Al Bidda Park guards are able to transfer to a better-paying job, but the workers say in practice it is very difficult, and believe that they still need their employer’s permission to seek other work. “If they gave [permission] … 90% would have changed jobs,” said one. “Even when we are sleeping, we dream of changing our job,” added a colleague.Separately they all claim they had been forced to pay illegal recruitment fees – in the region of £1,175-£1,650 – to recruitment agents in their home countries to secure their jobs, effectively forcing them to work for up to five months just to repay the fee. And, while some football fans will enjoy the most opulent hotels in the world, some of these men sleep in bunk beds in over-crowded labour camps on the edge of the desert.The Guardian visited one camp which houses the guards and found rooms with four bunk beds crammed end-to-end around the edge of a tiny space. There were no lockers, so the men shared their beds with their belongings or a suitcase. Cooking utensils were stuffed under the beds. Two large grimy kitchens and foul-smelling toilet cubicles stood outside. One guard said the toilets were so bad in his camp that he preferred to wait and use the ones at the park.It is a world few football fans will see. Turn off a four-lane highway out of Doha and on to a potholed road and the only traffic is an endless flow of buses and minivans shipping men to and from their workplace. The road leads to dozens of accommodation blocks amid wasteland covered in litter. Outside each block, men sit on rocks scrolling through their phones while stray dogs play in the dust. A homemade basketball hoop is the only sign of normal life.Today the Building and Wood Workers’ International, a trade union which has worked in partnership with the Qatari authorities to improve workers’ rights in the country, issued a strong-worded statement saying, ‘there is no sign that sustainable change [for migrant workers] is forthcoming.’A Qatari government official said, “Over the past decade, extensive action has been taken to combat exploitative labour practices and provide accessible channels for workers to make complaints … When violations are recorded, corrective action is taken, and offending companies are penalised.”The official said over 420,000 workers have changed their employer since a new law was introduced in 2020, which made it easier to change jobs. Last month, 3,712 labour inspections were carried out, he added, and 97% of workers are covered by the wage protection system, “which ensures all wages are paid in full and on time.”“Systemic change does not happen in an instant – it takes time to transform a labour market. In other countries, this was a decades-long process, and in many countries – including in Europe – this process is still ongoing.“Hundreds of thousands of workers have benefited from our labour reforms, and our commitment to improving the lives of every expatriate who has made Qatar a second home will continue long after the World Cup,” the official said.The managing director of the Al Nasr Star Group confirmed the guards work 12-hour shifts but said that they get two hours’ break each day and one day off a week. The security guards who spoke to the Guardian claim they do not routinely get breaks during their working day, although one worker did say he was given breaks from work during the summer months.The company did not respond to repeated requests for a written response to the allegations put to the Guardian by its workers or provide timesheets or information on pay for security guards working at Al Bidda."
Woman’s murderer had been ordered back to prison before attack ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/18/man-29-pleads-guilty-to-murder-of-zara-aleena,"The man who murdered Zara Aleena was ordered to be returned to prison two days before the attack, but was left free to hunt the law graduate before kicking and stamping her to death.Jordan McSweeney, 29, pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to the murder and sexual assault of Aleena on 26 June 2022, in Ilford, east London.Aleena, who worked as a court official, was followed, grabbed from behind, pulled from the street and dragged on to a driveway before McSweeney kicked and stamped on her.McSweeney committed the murder nine days after being released on licence from prison on 17 June for an earlier offence of robbery.However, the Guardian has learned, he had been recalled to prison two days before the attack and should not have been free.The Metropolitan police said it was told he had been recalled to prison on 24 June for breaching his licence conditions, a decision taken by the Probation Service. The Met said McSweeney, a serial offender, failed immediately on his release from prison on licence to attend appointments with probation officers, missing meetings on 17 and 20 June, but police were not informed to arrest him until a week later.The Ministry of Justice has launched an internal review into how an offender committed a serious further offence. The Met said “within hours” of being asked to find McSweeney they were searching for him, but could not find him.The force said an internal inquiry had exonerated officers involved. The police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct, said they had not been informed.The Met said: “Any lessons learnt have been shared within the Met and with partners”, but declined to say who those were.On 26 June McSweeney went to a pub before hunting for a woman to attack. He chose Aleena, 35, by chance as she walked on Cranbrook Road, an area she knew well.She was found partially naked by a passerby in the street close to her home in Ilford, east London, with extensive head injuries at 2.44am. Paramedics spent more than 90 minutes at the scene trying to save her, but she died later in hospital.As she was attacked, her screams awoke residents, who called the emergency services. So violent was the assault that McSweeney left a fingerprint in Aleena’s blood on a wall next to the driveway.The evening before, Aleena had gone out with friends. She first went to the Great Spoon of Ilford pub at about 8.30pm. Coincidentally, McSweeney was there and can be seen on CCTV looking for women, approaching one when she went outside for a cigarette.Aleena and her friends then went to a nearby sports bar, where she drank water. She left at 2am, deciding to walk the short distance home. After she left the bar a friend checked up on her, sending her a WhatsApp message that read: “Are you home hon?”Shortly after midnight on 26 June, CCTV shows, McSweeney was looking for women in the Cranbrook Road area. Before the attack on Aleena, he spotted another woman and pursued her, but she got away.Aleena had wanted to be a lawyer since the age of five and had a law degree from the University of Westminster. Since May, five weeks before her death, she had been working as an administrative officer at the Royal Courts of Justice in central London, and had previously worked to resettle refugees.McSweeney was arrested in Dagenham, east London, at the funfair where he was working. A search of his caravan found bloodstained clothing and shoes stuffed in a bag, similar to those worn by the attacker on CCTV. He will be sentenced at a later date. He had been convicted on 28 occasions for more than 69 previous offences including assaults on police, assaults on civilians, theft, burglary, racially aggravated offences and driving offences. One source said there was nothing in his criminal history flagging that he was a sexual danger to women.After his arrest on 27 June, McSweeney refused to answer questions and spoke only to make threats to officers – threatening to bite off one officer’s face – and to say that he suffered from an attention deficit and split personality disorder.At an earlier hearing, the prosecutor, Oliver Glasgow KC, said: “‘[This was] a stranger attack on a lone female late at night making her way home, a woman who stood no chance of survival.”Olcay Sapanoglu, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: “Having followed her for several minutes, he pulled Zara into the driveway of a house, where he carried out his assault. He sexually assaulted her, then brutally stamped on her several times before appearing to walk away. Moments later he returned, only to stamp on her several times more and then, finally, leaving her for dead.“McSweeney did not display a shred of humanity towards Zara. Indeed, having completed his initial assault he returned to inflict further injuries, leading to her death.”DCI Dave Whellams said: “She was attacked while walking alone on a residential street. She had every right to be there. She had every right to feel safe. Instead, she was a victim of shocking violence.”The killing comes amid heightened concern about the safety of women on Britain’s streets. Aleena’s aunt, Farah Naz, speaking shortly after her niece’s death, placed her family’s suffering in the context of the high levels of violence women face, saying: “I want to speak to the leaders of this country, I want to talk about the setting up of projects right now to prevent violence.”Naz said the death of her niece, who the family called Zash or Zasherooni, came after the cases of recent killings of women, such as Bibaa Henry, Nicole Smallman, Sarah Everard and Sabina Nessa.Naz said Aleena felt safe walking the streets where she lived: “Zara was not a woman who was unaware that there were dangers in the world. She did not imagine what happened to those women would happen to her. She didn’t know she was going to be on this list because in her mind she took those precautions.”"
"Sunak and Hunt out of touch with working class, say ‘red wall’ voters",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/nov/18/sunak-and-hunt-out-of-touch-with-working-class-say-red-wall-voters,"Rishi Sunak is “out of touch with reality” and “absolutely not” on the side of the working class, voters in the “red wall” seat of Leigh told the Guardian after the first autumn statement of his premiership.The prime minister and the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, spent the days leading up to Thursday claiming those with the broadest shoulders would pay their fair share. Jeremy Hunt repeated the mantra “Britain is a compassionate country”, and pledged to protect the most vulnerable in society amid the worst fall in living standards on record.But members of a focus group from the 40,000-strong town in greater Manchester, organised by More in Common for the Guardian, believe Sunak and Hunt have left “working people to foot this bill”. They added that the government had even shunned the middle class. “I voted Tory at the last election, but would I do it again? I’m not sure,” said Tracy, a 52-year-old team sales manager.“I have worked since I was 14 years old, working for more than 30 years and I should now be reaping those rewards as I’ve never missed a day off work. But it feels like someone is saying I can’t because someone else is taking it away because of greed. God bless those single mothers,” she added, before signalling how much the oil giant BP had earned in profits this year.Sunak’s decisions were perceived to look only after himself and other wealthy people and not make the group’s circumstances better, they said. This, they added, was the main takeaway from the budget, rather than it being Hunt’s first test as chancellor or a consequence of Liz Truss’s mini-budget. Asked to describe the budget in a few words, they said it was “driving anxiety”, “mental”, “unrealistic”, “bankrupt” and “shit”.The prime minister has “no idea what it’s like to live month to month, or what it’s like to live on the bread line and decide whether you will put your kids in clothes or give them food that month”, said Jade. Sunak had “married into a billionaire’s family”, the 32-year-old said, and would only ever “help his kind of people”.She added: “Liz Truss is just a name to blame. This has been a long time coming. We were always going to be up against these tax rises.” Colleen, 30, who works in finance, agreed, describing Truss as a “scapegoat”.Primary school site manager Craig, 42, who did not find the gloomy budget “a big surprise” given how much money had been spent over the last three to four years, said Truss had “inherited” a lot of problems from Boris when he was forced out. “It was always a poisoned chalice,” he added. But the group had no such sympathy for Sunak or Hunt.They admitted to not being aware of the non-dom status loophole that approximately 68,300 individuals in the UK use, but were furious when they realised the government had not made them pay their fair share of tax. “How should you be able to get away with that?” Jade asked, leading to her and others to question whether Sunak was “on their side”.All members responded with a resounding “no”. “Absolutely not,” Tracy added, claiming he’s not “in touch with reality” or the working class because of his millionaire family. “I don’t think he’s a leader of this country. I don’t think he actually understands. He’s apparently very intelligent, but I don’t think he’s in touch with reality.”Members of the focus group also questioned if there were any politicians from any party who understood what it can be like living month to month. “Labour are telling us what we want to hear because they want to be in,” Jade said.Craig added: “If you look at anyone going to the post [of prime minister or leading a party] now, most of them haven’t lived hand-to-mouth, and have not been part of the working class.”Craig described how difficult it had been seeing his real-term wage fall and feeling as though he could not receive support from the government. When asked if it was right for the government to raise benefits in line with inflation, he was the only member able to respond, classing it as a “sore subject”. “In real terms, [my partner and I are] worse off than we were two and a half years ago. We’re above the benefits level, but we’re not on 50 or 60 grand a year,” he said.Louise, a 33-year-old single mother of five who works in a specialist children’s school, said she had been forced not to put the heating on, and endures hearing her children asking for warmth. “One of my children is autistic, and if he gets cold he’s in meltdown. It’s got to the point where my kids will say: ‘Mum, I’ve put my hoodie on, I’ve but a blanket on, and I’m still cold,’” she added.Tracy said: “The government has lost sight of what made this country great at one time. We’re now at a point where people question what you have to do to make a better life for yourself?”Colleen, 30, also questioned why she had voted Conservative. “In terms of credibility, the Conservatives have gone down and down and down,” she said, with group members nodding unanimously.The pension triple lock was a much easier subject, as everyone thought pensioners deserved to enjoy the money they had worked hard for over their lifetime. Charity product manager Tiffany, 30, added: “Just because they live in a million-pound house, doesn’t mean that their heating has been on.”Leigh went to the Tories for the first time in more than 100 years at the last election. Recent research has found Sunak is likely to win back blue wall voters who abandoned the Tories under Boris Johnson over Partygate and Brexit, but has more of a challenge wooing typical red wall voters. Fewer than a third (32%) who switched to the Tories in 2019 said they would continue to vote the same way if asked, according to a poll by Public First for More in Common.Luke Tryl, the UK director of More in Common, said: “Whether it was rising prices, rising interest rates or the measures announced in this budget, this group were angry and fed up at working families being constantly squeezed.“The biggest worry for the Tories must be that while this group of first-time 2019 Tory voters understood the importance of getting the economy back on track, they didn’t think the people making the decisions about how to sort things out understood their lives or were on their side.”"
Mike Bloomberg forced to apologise after Boris Johnson speech criticising China,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/nov/18/mike-bloomberg-forced-to-apologise-after-boris-johnson-speech-criticising-china,"The billionaire financier Mike Bloomberg was forced to apologise to hundreds of guests at a major Asian business event in Singapore this week after complaints about a speech by Boris Johnson that robustly criticised China.The former UK prime minister, the after-dinner speaker at the flagship Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Singapore on Tuesday, was said to have described China as a “coercive autocracy” to about 500 Asian businesspeople, investors and diplomats.While his comments would not be regarded as controversial in the UK, where there is concern over Beijing’s human rights record, approach to Taiwan and closeness to Russia, the majority of Asian countries are much more favourably inclined towards China and share strong economic and diplomatic ties.In remarks that may alarm Rishi Sunak’s government and bolster his own support among Conservative MPs, Johnson is also said to have announced that he was taking a “temporary hiatus” from the frontline of British politics, suggesting he still harbours ambitions of returning to power.Bloomberg, who invited Johnson and whose organisation was hosting the event in partnership with the Singapore government, acknowledged in the opening session of the conference on Wednesday that some attendees may have been “insulted or offended” by Johnson’s remarks in his speech the previous evening.But the businessman, a former mayor of New York and friend of Johnson, clarified that they were “his thoughts and his thoughts alone”. He added: “To those of you who were upset and concerned by what the speaker said, you have my apologies.”Johnson’s remarks came the evening before Sunak was due to hold a surprise meeting with Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in Bali. The talks were cancelled, but would have made him the first UK prime minister to meet the Chinese premier in person for almost five years.Downing Street had said Sunak wanted to recalibrate the UK’s relationship with Beijing by trying to have a new “frank and constructive” dialogue. But it was interpreted by wary Tory hawks as a thawing of relations between Britain and the Asian superpower, after Liz Truss’s more overtly hostile approach.According to the former prime minister’s spokesperson, he told the audience: “Let’s look at Russia and China. The two former communist tyrannies in which power has once again been concentrated in the hands of a single ruler. Two monocultural states that have been traditionally hostile to immigration and that are becoming increasingly nationalist in their attitudes.“Two permanent UN security council members that back each other up and enable each other and which are willing to show a candid disregard for the rule of international law, and two countries that in the last year have demonstrated the immense limitations of their political systems by the disastrous mistakes they have made.”One guest at the Singapore dinner told the Guardian: “Boris was typically funny and charming but he was also pretty belligerent in his criticism of a bunch of foreign governments, especially China and Russia, which he described as coercive autocracies. In Britain it would have been absolutely fine to single out China. But in Asia it wasn’t.”Another added: “Boris was very, very critical. The speech was pretty shocking. People clearly people felt uncomfortable. He used very undiplomatic language about China, at a conference in Asia. A former British foreign secretary and prime minister should have known better.”The response from attendees at the dinner in the five-star Fullerton Bay hotel, believed to include some Chinese businesspeople, prompted Bloomberg to apologise in person. He told the conference: “Some may have been insulted or offended last night by parts of the speaker’s remarks referencing certain countries and their duly elected leaders.“Those were his thoughts and his thoughts alone, not cleared in advance by anyone nor shared with me personally. Bloomberg and NEF’s forums are a diverse group of views, and the presentation was meant as after-dinner entertainment rather than serious discussion of important controversial and complex issues.“And I’m sure you know based on many years of interaction with us that our respect for all points of view and those that serve in government is complete and heartfelt. To those of you who were upset and concerned by what the speaker said, you have my apologies.“And if you weren’t upset, perhaps you’ve enjoyed Boris Johnson – he is who he is, … he’s very controversial but also very entertaining. He was trying to be amusing rather than informative and serious, and I think we need to give him a little bit of credit for that.”A spokesman for the former prime minister said: “Mr Johnson is robust in his criticism of authoritarianism and autocracy – including in Russia and China – and will continue to be so. He will continue to make the case for freedom and democracy on the world stage”.A spokesperson for Bloomberg declined to comment.Since he was ousted as prime minister, Johnson has been topping up his MP’s earnings by touring the world for a string of lucrative speaking engagements. The latest MPs’ register of interests shows he was paid £276,130 plus expenses for a speech to insurance agents in the US. His latest trip to Singapore took place while the House of Commons was sitting, though he was back for Thursday’s budget.Johnson’s political career has been peppered with a string of damaging diplomatic gaffes. In 2013, he suggested that a rise in the number of Malaysian women attending university was down to their desire to find a husband. Two years later, he claimed the “part-Kenyan” US president Barack Obama had an “ancestral dislike” of the UK, prompting an international outcry.In January 2017, the then foreign secretary was caught on camera reciting a colonial-era poem by Rudyard Kipling in front of local dignitaries while on an official trip to Myanmar. Johnson, who was accused of “incredible insensitivity”, had been inside a sacred Buddhist temple at the time.Later that year, he was criticised for making incorrect statement that the jailed British-Iranian Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been “teaching people journalism” rather than being on holiday in Iran. His comments were later cited as proof by Iran that she was engaged in “propaganda against the regime”."
Russia says Ukrainian soldiers executed prisoners of war in region,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/18/russia-says-ukrainian-soldiers-executed-prisoners-of-war-in-donbas-region,"The Kremlin has accused Ukrainian soldiers of executing more than 10 Russian prisoners of war following the circulation of a video on social media purporting to be from the frontline.The footage appears to show a group of Russian soldiers emerging from an outbuilding in the grounds of a house with their hands above their heads before they are told to lie facedown.One of the men wearing all black, however, seems to turn his gun on what appears to be a Ukrainian unit of soldiers wearing yellow armbands as he emerges from the half-destroyed outhouse.The footage, seemingly taken by a Ukrainian soldier, suggests that all the Russians, including those in a prone position, were killed in the violence that followed. There are at least 12 bodies.The incident was said to have taken place in the grounds of a house near the village of Makiivka in the eastern Luhansk region of Ukraine, which is part of a wider area known as the Donbas.Neither the location nor the identity of those featuring in the video could be immediately independently verified.Ukraine’s ministry of defence did not respond to a request for comment.A spokesperson for Russia’s ministry of defence said: “This brutal murder of Russian servicemen is neither the first nor the only war crime.“This is common practice in the Armed Forces of Ukraine that is actively supported by the Kyiv regime and blatantly ignored by its western patrons.”The Russian defence ministry went on to claim that the footage showed “the deliberate and methodical murder of more than 10 immobilised Russian servicemen by degenerate Ukrainian soldiers”.The spokesperson said the Ukrainian government would be held responsible for “every prisoner tortured and killed”.The conflict in Ukraine that followed Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade the country on 24 February has seen both sides trade accusations of war crimes.In response to previous allegations, Ukraine’s foreign ministry has said it will investigate any incidents, although none of the probes appear to have come to any conclusion.The Kremlin has not made any such promise in relation to the host of allegations of the torture of combatants and civilians in Ukraine by its forces and the mercenaries fighting on Russia’s behalf.A war crime is defined by the United Nations as a serious breach of international law committed against civilians or enemy forces during an armed conflict."
UK facing Christmas travel chaos as civil servants from three departments to strike,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/nov/18/civil-servants-in-three-whitehall-departments-to-go-on-strike-for-a-month,"Civil servants in three Whitehall departments will take “sustained” strike action for a month from mid-December, as the first step in an “escalating” campaign, the Public and Commercial Services union has announced.Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the PCS, said the initial action in the Home Office, Department for Transport and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, would involve “low thousands” of the 100,000 members who backed strike action in a recent ballot.But he said the strikes would be tailored to cause maximum disruption across public services, including passport and border checks, driving tests and farm payments, throughout the Christmas period.“I hope that people can travel at Christmas without disruption, but that’s down to Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt,” he said, calling on ministers to put more money on the table to resolve the dispute.Some of the staff involved will take “short bursts” of action, while others will stay off work for the entire month-long period, he said. Civil servants represented by the PCS have been offered a 2% pay rise. Serwotka said many are claiming benefits and even resorting to food banks.In Thursday’s autumn statement, Hunt stuck to previous spending plans for most departments, despite soaring inflation, leaving little leeway for more generous pay settlements.Serwotka said the PCS would step up its action over the coming months unless the government acceded to its members’ demands for a 10% pay rise, a reversal of cuts to redundancy pay, and an agreement on job security. “We have a mandate here for six months of industrial action – that’s what the law allows. Our proposals are that this would be an escalating action that will start with this,” he said.The union said it would not discuss specific dates or locations, to avoid helping the government to prepare what Serwotka called “strike-breaking” plans.With teachers currently balloting over strike action and nurses already having backed strikes, Serwotka said there was a growing likelihood of coordinated action in the New Year across different sectors. “I think you’ll see escalation within the civil service, but you will also see escalation on a much broader basis, unless something changes,” he said.Public sector pay is rising at an average annual rate of 2.2%, against 6.6% in the private sector, increasing the pressure on the government to find more resources to recruit and retain staff in key services.A government spokesperson said: “We regret this decision. We greatly value the work of civil servants across the country, but the PCS union’s demands would cost an unaffordable £2.4bn at a time when our focus must be on bringing down inflation to ease the pressure on households across the country, protect the vulnerable and rebuild our economy. Discussions will continue, but we can provide reassurance that we have comprehensive plans in place to keep essential services running and to minimise disruption if these PCS strikes do go ahead.”"
Somerset woman speaks out on childhood abuse by brother,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/nov/18/somerset-woman-speaks-out-on-childhood-abuse-by-brother,"A woman who was sexually abused by her older brother half a century ago when she was a young girl has waived her right to anonymity to describe her decades of torment and to encourage other survivors of familial abuse to come forward.Liz Roberts, 59, a former police officer, said the abuse carried out by Andrew Herbert when she was about eight had led to a life of self-loathing and shame punctuated by episodes of depression, anxiety and self-harm.“I felt unloved, unlovable, weak and stupid,” Roberts said. “I felt guilt and shame. It’s important now to put the shame where it belongs. It’s not my shame, it’s his. I’ve watched him for the last 50 years living a big life while I’ve been in the shadows, shrinking away. If I don’t speak out, he’ll reinvent himself and carry on and I’ll go back into the darkness.”Describing familial sexual abuse as a “hidden scourge”, she said: “I’m aware this is happening to some kid right now and there are thousands of people whose lives are being poisoned.”Herbert, 67, from Goodrich in Herefordshire, was given a two-year community order at Bristol crown court on 4 November after admitting 10 counts of indecent assault against Roberts and a second girl in the early 1970s. He was ordered to undertake sex offender treatment, do 225 hours of unpaid work, and will be subject to a curfew and restraining orders. The judge, Julian Lambert, said: “These were very serious offences with the most severe effects.”Roberts, who was brought up in south Bristol in a strict Catholic family, said Herbert was often in trouble as a boy and young man, always pushing boundaries.When she was about seven or eight and her brother about 15, he sexually abused her over a number of months. “He did it in a wheedling, pleading kind of way and it was terrifying,” she said.“I felt scared and miserable all the time. I remember smells, touch, feel. You don’t know words like sexual abuse but you know it shouldn’t be happening. It was compounded by the fact it was done in a family environment where you’re supposed to feel safe.”It was only during the court case that Roberts realised her brother played on her love of horses, inventing a game called “bucking broncos” in which he would let her ride on his back. The game would turn into abuse. “I didn’t realise until the trial that he had groomed me in that way. That was clever.”Roberts went on to become a police officer in Bristol, then worked as a rep for a pharmaceutical company and now is the managing director of an online learning company. She is a mother of two and grandmother of one.Over the years she has had an eating disorder and low self-esteem and trust issues. “I get flashbacks. It seems to get easier and then something will happen and, whoosh, it’s all back again. If you have a stressful situation you overreact, you’re on hyper alert. At the first sign of trouble you go into meltdown.”When she first confronted her brother several years ago, he began to cry. “And then he went on about his problems. I boxed it all back up and carried on.”Roberts began intense psychotherapy and she wrote to Herbert, who was married and a father, detailing what she felt about the abuse. She ended: “I’m asking you to leave me alone. I never want to hear from you again.”To her surprise, he wrote back, accepting he had abused her. She realised she had evidence and went to the police. In court, he claimed he was suffering from a “tsunami” of guilt. “But honestly it was a tsunami of self-pity. He’s just been caught,” Roberts said.As a police officer in the 80s, Roberts said, she saw first-hand that survivors of sexual abuse were often not believed or taken seriously. But she has been impressed by the support she has been given by the police, the Crown Prosecution Service and organisations that provide help and counselling. “There’s a lot of support for survivors,” she said.Roberts said she hoped her story would give confidence to other survivors to come forward, and she plans to campaign on the issue. “Familial sexual abuse is a hidden scourge and I think it happens far more often than we think. People like Andrew get away with it by passing their guilt and shame and literally hiding in plain sight.”Roberts, who now lives in west Somerset, said she was determined to “sort this” for the little girl abused by her brother. Pointing to a photo of herself as a seven-year-old feeding a horse on a beach, she said: “I’m telling that girl it’s safe now, he can’t hurt me any more, he won’t hurt anyone else. He’s the one who did wrong.”"

US attorney general to reportedly appoint special counsel in Trump criminal investigation,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2022/nov/18/jan-6-trump-republicans-house-democrats-us-politics-latest,"The plan for a special counsel appears to be linked to allegations of the unlawful retention of national defense information at former president Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort and residence in Florida, according to the Reuters news agency, which cites an unnamed senior Department of Justice official.The agency says a senior DoJ official has named a special prosecutor to investigate the entirety of the department’s criminal investigation into that potential offense.Meanwhile, CNN reports that the special counsel will also review the parallel DoJ investigation into Trump’s involvement around the insurrection on January 6, 2021, when extremist supporters of the-then president invaded the US Capitol in an attempt to prevent the certification of Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election by congress.We will bring you more developments as they happen.Attorney general Merrick Garland plans to hold a press conference at 2:15 pm eastern time, following reports that he will name a special prosecutor to decide whether to bring charges against Donald Trump and his allies.Beyond just the investigation into government secrets Trump allegedly retained at his Mar-a-Lago resort, Politico reports that the special counsel will also look into Trump’s attempts to undermine the 2020 election. The justice department has not yet announced who they will be appointed to job.This blog will cover Garland’s address as it happens.The plan for a special counsel appears to be linked to allegations of the unlawful retention of national defense information at former president Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort and residence in Florida, according to the Reuters news agency, which cites an unnamed senior Department of Justice official.The agency says a senior DoJ official has named a special prosecutor to investigate the entirety of the department’s criminal investigation into that potential offense.Meanwhile, CNN reports that the special counsel will also review the parallel DoJ investigation into Trump’s involvement around the insurrection on January 6, 2021, when extremist supporters of the-then president invaded the US Capitol in an attempt to prevent the certification of Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election by congress.We will bring you more developments as they happen.US attorney general Merrick Garland plans to name a special counsel to examine whether former president Donald Trump should be prosecuted as a result of investigations carried out by the Department if Justice (DoJ), the Wall Street Journal reports, citing an unnamed source “familiar with the matter”.The Journal reports:“A formal announcement, which is expected by Friday afternoon, would come three days after Mr. Trump announced another bid for the presidency and would mark the naming of the third independent prosecutor in five years to examine issues involving Mr. Trump. The exact scope of the special counsel’s remit and who it would be couldn’t be determined.”More details to come…A judge refused today to quash a subpoena issued to former White House press secretary Jen Psaki that seeks her deposition in a lawsuit filed by Missouri and Louisiana, alleging that the Biden administration conspired to silence conservative voices on social media, the Associated Press reports.Psaki filed a motion in federal court in Alexandria seeking to quash the subpoena, saying that she had no relevant information to provide and that a deposition would place an undue burden on her. The Justice Department supported her efforts to quash.US magistrate Ivan Davis said during a hearing today that he was unimpressed with Psaki’s arguments. But he did not reject her request outright. Instead, he transferred the case back to Louisiana, where the lawsuit was filed.Psaki was allowed to file a separate opposition in Virginia because she lives in the state and would be deposed there.Davis, though, said it makes no sense for him to wade into the questions of whether Psaki’s testimony is relevant when the judge in Louisiana is more familiar with the case.He also said Psaki failed to show how sitting for a deposition in her home state would be an undue burden. In fact, he said that if Psaki has little information to contribute, as she alleges, it shouldn’t be much of a burden at all.Justice Department lawyer Indraneel Sur indicated he would appeal Davis’ ruling to a district judge in Alexandria and asked the judge to stay his ruling to provide time to do so, but Davis declined.The lawsuit filed by the attorney general in Missouri and Alexandria accuses Joe Biden, former federal health official Anthony Fauci and others of conspiring with social media companies to restrict free speech by censoring conservative opinions about the Covid-19 response and other issues.Readers will have noticed that politicians, and indeed journalists and people, are still tweeting. But for how much longer?Here’s the Guardian’s Kari Paul:Amid ongoing fallout from Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter, speculation of the platform’s imminent collapse is swirling – leaving users wondering what parts of their online selves they’ll get to keep.After Musk laid off thousands of workers, many users have reported signs the platform is falling apart in real time – from glitching home pages to log-in failures – and researchers are desperately urging users to download their tweets in case Twitter implodes completely.“If there’s something you care about on Twitter, now’s the time to become like a temporary expert in digital archiving measures,” said Caroline Sinders, an artificial intelligence researcher and founder of human rights lab Convocation Research and Design.Digital archiving – the process of preserving online content for future use – has expanded steadily since the launch of the internet, but still exists in a patchwork, decentralized framework.There’s more to read, here. But the last bit is killer:If you want to save tweets – whether jokes from a favorite celebrity or the last thoughts of a loved one who has passed – an expert suggests a relatively analog solution.“Print out their tweets, and put them in a box,” the expert said. “They will last longer in every way.”He may still be the most popular man in the Republican party, but Donald Trump’s announcement of a new run for the White House this week has been fodder for his opponents, most recently his former top diplomat Mike Pompeo. Meanwhile, conservatives have continued their quest to stop Kevin McCarthy from becoming speaker in the Republican-run House next year, while Democrats’ transition away from Nancy Pelosi’s leadership appears to be running much more smoothly.Here’s what else has happened today so far:Donald Trump’s former top diplomat Mike Pompeo has again attacked his one-time boss:Pompeo’s wording echoes Trump’s promise on the campaign trail 2016 that if he was elected, supporters would “get tired of winning.” Pompeo, who served as secretary of state from 2018 till the end of Trump’s term in 2021, is thought to be considering a run for the presidency in 2024.Perhaps he’ll elaborate on his thoughts about the former president in his speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition later today:The Biden administration has petitioned the supreme court to allow its plan to relieve some student debt relief to proceed, Bloomberg News reports:Biden in August announced the plan to forgive as much as $20,000 in federal student debt for people earning less than $125,000 a year, or households earning below $250,000.Conservative activists and states immediately sued to stop the program, and last month, an effort by six Republican-led states succeeded in getting it temporarily halted.Why didn’t last week’s midterm elections produce a landslide victory for Republicans? Why did so many people vote for Democrats, despite Joe Biden’s approval rating being underwater for more than a year?Definitive answers to these questions are elusive, no matter how important they may be. The Guardian surveyed readers for their views on last Tuesday’s polls, and you can read what they had to say below: New York Democrat Hakeem Jeffries formally announced his bid for House Democratic leader in a letter to colleagues released today.“When I initially sought the position of Chair of the House Democratic Caucus two terms ago, none of us could have predicted the challenges the American people would confront in the years to come. However, time and again, throughout a period of enormous turmoil for our nation, House Democrats rose to the occasion,” Jeffries said.“Today, I write to humbly ask for your support for the position of House Democratic Leader as we once again prepare to meet the moment.”Jeffries’s candidacy comes after House speaker Nancy Pelosi yesterday announced she would not seek a position in Democratic leadership next year, but would remain as a lawmaker. House majority leader Steny Hoyer also said yesterday he would step down from leadership, paving the way for a new generation of Democrats to lead the party in Congress's lower chamber. Jeffries is expected to be joined by Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, who is seeking the position of whip, which is the Democrats’ number-two position in the House and responsible for rallying lawmakers for or against legislation. Pete Aguilar of California is set to run for the third-ranking position of caucus chair.In a statement released today, Pelosi signaled her support for the trio. “In the 118th Congress, House Democrats will be led by a trio that reflects our beautiful diversity of our nation. Chair Jeffries, Assistant Speaker Clark and Vice Chair Aguilar know that, in our Caucus, diversity is our strength and unity is our power,” Pelosi wrote. “A new day is dawning – and I am confident that these new leaders will capably lead our Caucus and the Congress.”The House GOP may be gearing up to investigate the Biden administration, but first it needs to decide who the chamber’s speaker will be.Caucus leader Kevin McCarthy is considered a frontrunner, but faced opposition this week during the vote to determine the party’s nominee for the position. While McCarthy prevailed, the episode, coupled with the GOP’s expected razor-thin majority in the chamber, raised the possibility of a contentious speakership election when the new Congress begins on 3 January. Today, rightwing congressman Andy Biggs reiterated his opposition to McCarthy’s candidacy. Biggs mounted an unsuccessful challenge to McCarthy in the election held Tuesday for House speaker nominee.Joining in the sentiment was fellow conservative congressman Matt Gaetz:However, Paul Ryan, the last Republican to serve as House speaker, thinks McCarthy will put it off. “I know all the people. I know the players. I think he’s going to be fine,” Ryan told Politico on Thursday.While the effort may not end in impeachment, the incoming Republican House majority is already pushing for testimony from top homeland security officials, including secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.GOP lawmakers on the judiciary committee sent the department a letter today requesting documents and testimony from a range of officials:Should these hearings occur next year, expect the committee’s new Republican leadership to spend much of their time exploring the situation at the southern border, where migrant arrivals have lately hit records. The GOP has sought to blame the Biden administration for the influx, and will likely use an appearance by Mayorkas and top officials in US Customs and Border Protection to make their case.Republicans may have retaken the majority in the House, but their narrow margin of control is already affecting their priorities.One of the consequences is that it’s made it less likely the party will launch impeachment proceedings against Joe Biden or one of his cabinet secretaries, such as homeland security chief Alejandro Mayorkas, or attorney general Merrick Garland, Politico reports.The piece has a number of Republicans who hold moderate views or represent swing districts cautioning against attempts to force the Democratic leaders out of office, which would have virtually no chance of succeeding since Biden’s allies still control the Senate.“I want to warn our colleagues: There may be some activists in our party that want impeachment. But I can tell you that the swing voters and the independent voters don’t. …We change leadership by elections, impeachment is the outlier,” Don Bacon of Nebraska says, expressing a sentiment common among GOP lawmakers quoted in the piece.Even Marjorie Taylor Greene, one of the most far-right Republicans in Congress, wasn’t quick to endorse impeachment proceedings when approached by Politico. “I think that what we’re going to do is be proving everything through investigations and evidence. … So we’ve got to do the work on the committee, but I think there will be plenty of evidence to show that,” Greene said.While Republicans managed to claw back control of Congress’s lower house last week, The Guardian’s Sam Levine reports Democrats made gains in state legislatures nationwide, with potentially significant consequences for voting and abortion rights:While Democrats staved off a red wave in Washington during the midterm elections, the party’s most significant victories came far away from the US capitol. They were in state legislatures across the country with consequences that will be felt for years to come.Over the last decade, Republicans have quietly amassed power in state capitols, investing in races for state legislatures that can be decided by just a few hundred votes. It’s an investment that has paid off wildly. Since state legislatures draw electoral districts in many places, Republicans have used that advantage to entrench their power, drawing district lines that further guaranteed their majorities. They’ve also used those majorities to pass measures that make it harder to vote, strip LGBTQ+ protections, loosen gun laws and restrict access to abortion.Further complicating attempts to hold Donald Trump accountable is his return to the campaign trail. Chris McGreal looks at just how much of a factor his decision might play:The law is clear. The politics less so.If Donald Trump’s third run for the White House is propelled by large doses of narcissism and revenge, the former US president must also be hoping that a high-profile political campaign may help keep his myriad legal problems at bay before they bury him.Prosecutors from New York to Georgia and Washington DC have spent months digging into an array of alleged crimes before, during and after Trump was president. Some of those investigations are coming to fruition with indictments expected to follow within months, possibly weeks, on charges that potentially could see Trump become the first former US president to go to prison.His declaration that he is once again a candidate changes nothing under the law. Legal minds broadly agree that while a sitting president is protected from prosecution in office, that immunity disappears when they leave the White House.But then there is the politics of a prosecution against a presidential candidate who has already dismissed the investigations of his attempts to overturn the 2020 election, the hoarding of top secret documents, and allegedly fraudulent business practices, as “politically motivated” and a Democratic “witch-hunt”.Here’s more from The Guardian’s Hugo Lowell on the issue of the January 6 committee’s criminal referrals, which might be its most consequential piece of unfinished business:The House January 6 select committee has created a subcommittee to examine the scope of potential criminal referrals it might make to the justice department over the Capitol attack as well as what materials to share with federal prosecutors, its chairman and other members said on Thursday.The special subcommittee – led by Congressman Jamie Raskin, overseeing a four-person group that also involves Liz Cheney, Adam Schiff and Zoe Lofgren – has been chiefly focused on whether they have uncovered sufficient evidence that former US president Donald Trump violated civil and criminal statutes.The subcommittee has also been tasked with resolving several other outstanding issues, the panel’s chairman Bennie Thompson said. They include what materials to share with the justice department before the end of December, and its response to Trump and Republican lawmakers who have not complied with subpoenas.A reminder of some of the unfinished business awaiting the January 6 committee as the end of the year – and the end of its mandate – approach:First, there’s the matter of Donald Trump. At what was likely its final public hearing last month, the lawmakers publicly voted to subpoena the former president’s testimony and documents. While Trump reportedly was open to the idea of appearing publicly before a panel he has no love for, he ultimately decided to challenge the subpoena in court. According to Politico, the panel could as soon as today file its response to his legal challenge.As is typical for congressional select committees, the panel is expected to release a report detailing how the insurrection happened. It will probably be the most anticipated such document since the 9/11 Commission Report released in 2004.The committee also has to decide whether to make criminal referrals to the justice department. Several members have hinted that Trump’s actions during the insurrection amounted to criminal acts, and referring him to the justice department would be a consequential step. They could also refer some of his former officials to face charges, while Politico reports that the members are also looking into whether Trump and his allies tampered with witnesses.Good morning, US politics blog readers. It’s official: Republicans will take control of the House of Representatives when the new Congress starts on 3 January, which means the January 6 committee has only a few weeks left to finish up its investigation into the attack on the Capitol. The bipartisan panel is still interviewing witnesses with knowledge of Donald Trump’s actions and is expected to release a report before the year is finished. Meanwhile, Politico reports that they may as soon as today respond to the former president’s attempt to quash their subpoena compelling his testimony.Here’s what else we can expect today:This post has been corrected to indicate Biden will speak at 1:30 pm, not 1 pm."
Force's failings ‘materially contributed’ to murders of mother and daughter ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/18/police-failings-materially-contributed-to-murders-of-mother-and-daughter,"Police failings “materially contributed” to the deaths of a 22-year-old woman and her mother who were murdered by the daughter’s abusive former partner, an inquest has found.Raneem Oudeh and her mother, Khaola Saleem, 49, were stabbed to death by Oudeh’s estranged husband, Janbaz Tarin, in August 2018, after he had subjected her to stalking, domestic violence and coercive control for more than a year.The pair were killed outside Saleem’s home in Solihull while Oudeh was on the phone to West Midlands police, one of at least seven calls she made to emergency services in the run-up to her death, many of which were played to the jury.At Birmingham coroner’s court, an inquest into their deaths concluded on Friday that officers had breached the force’s domestic abuse policy on a number of occasions.The jury found that “officers failed to carry out effective investigations into potential offences” committed by Tarin, and “failed to take sufficient steps to safeguard Raneem”.Tarin previously admitted the double murder and was jailed for life with a minimum of 32 years in December 2018.Saleem’s sister, Nour Norris, said she had struggled to contain her anger when the 999 calls made by her niece were played out in court.“[Raneem] told them everything they needed to hear to arrest him from the first call. She told them about the abuse and how he threatened to take her life,” she told the Guardian.“The level of failure was appalling. There was so much evidence, but he wasn’t arrested even once, he wasn’t questioned even once. If the issue was addressed early enough, maybe Raneem and Khaola would be with us today.”The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said it found West Midlands police “missed opportunities” to take “positive action” for Oudeh and Saleem.IOPC regional director Derrick Campbell, added: “The circumstances of this case are shocking and profoundly disturbing, and I would like to express my sympathy to the family of Raneem and Khaola for their loss.“Our investigation found that satisfactory intelligence checks were not carried out when responding to incidents involving Raneem and her ex-partner. It was our view that WMP dealt with each incident in isolation and did not consider the cumulative effect and potential increase in the frequency and/or level of violence.”The inquest heard that Oudeh, who had a son from a previous relationship, had been subjected to months of violence and abuse at the hands of Tarin, who slept in a car outside her house when she tried to leave him. On one occasion he carved her name into his arm with a razor blade.A few months before her death, Oudeh had left Tarin as she believed he had a pregnant wife and children in his home country of Afghanistan who he had been keeping secret.In the first call to police on 2 April 2018, Raneem can be heard saying: “My old boyfriend, he is always forcing me to stay with him. He says: ‘I will kill you if you leave me.’” In a call the following month, she told police Tarin punched her in her face and stomach, although she later retracted her police complaint after speaking with Tarin.In August, Oudeh successfully served a non-molestation order on Tarin, a type of injunction against a partner.On the night of their murders, Tarin accosted Oudeh and her mother at a shisha lounge, and slapped Saleem in the face. Oudeh called the police four times, although officers were delayed by a firearms incident in the area, and she eventually asked to speak to police the following morning instead.She was still on the phone to the police when she returned to her mother’s house, where Tarin was waiting for them. Screaming can be heard in the background of the call, along with the words “he’s there, there, there”.The inquest concluded that police failed to keep adequate records of the separate incidents leading up to the murders, often leaving out Tarin’s threats to kill Oudeh, and that incidents were not treated with appropriate seriousness.Norris said: “At every stage they showed a dismissive attitude and a lack of understanding about domestic violence. And because they didn’t take strong action, the perpetrator used that against her, he was empowered by the police not arresting him. It made him think ‘Oh, I can do what I like here’. He would actually go to her and say, ‘Look, the police don’t believe you, no one believes you, I’ve got full control of you’.”Norris said that after a while Oudeh lost faith in the police and stopped calling, although alarmed neighbours continued to do so, in calls which were also played to the jury.“We didn’t realise how bad it was until we were in that courtroom. It was horrific. The failure by police was appalling,” she said.Hannana Siddiqui from women’s rights group Southall Black Sisters said “a dismissive attitude by some police officers betrays a deeper cultural failure to take domestic and honour based abuse seriously”.“These failures are both shocking and infuriating. They come after many other deaths of women with similar state failures. We call for a public inquiry on femicide,” she said.Norris said the family have pushed relentlessly to highlight the importance of police training and knowledge of domestic abuse and coercive control, and want to see action taken by police.“The last thing I want is this case to close and it gets brushed under the carpet,” she said. “We want West Midlands police to apologise in full in public, but we want them to actually give a promise to the public that they’re going to change the system and they are going to make things different.“At least for the honour of Khaola and Raneem, I want people to be saved and I want changes to be made.”Andy Hill, assistant chief constable of West Midlands police, said the murders were “among the most shocking and appalling crimes in our region in recent years”.“On behalf of West Midlands police, I would like to apologise to Raneem and Khaola’s family – we should have done more. It is clear that we should have done more to join-up the incidents of abuse that were being reported to us so that the officers considering Raneem’s case had a full picture of the ordeal that Raneem was enduring at the hands of Janbaz Tarin.”He said changes had already been made at the force, including increasing the number of staff specifically investigating domestic abuse offences, the creation of a new team to review investigations and more training for frontline officers.“We recognise, however, that more needs to be done,” he said. “We will continue to learn from the tragic events at the heart of this inquest.”"

Kherson’s leaders toil to turn city around,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/18/kherson-leaders-toil-to-turn-city-around-ukraine,"Before the war, the problems faced by the residents of Kherson were similar to those in many European cities: salaries, corruption, addiction, the need to improve public services. Now they centre on obtaining the means of survival: water, heat, food, electricity and connection to the outside world.Many villages in the Kherson region have been without electricity, gas and running water for months. Kherson city’s electricity and water supply was cut off about two weeks ago as the Russians fled, and not everyone had a gas supply.Almost a week after Ukrainian forces retook the city, residents were wandering around carrying 5-litre plastic water bottles on trolleys, full or empty. They could be overheard asking each other where to find bread and discussing how many days it had been since they had seen milk in the shops. In some residential courtyards, people were gathered around campfires, cooking food and boiling water.In Kherson’s central square, where some were still taking pictures next to the Ukrainian flags, a large crowd had gathered. They were standing packed close together but often facing opposite directions and were glued to their phones. They were there for the new 4G mast, one of several the returning Ukrainian authorities have set up in the city centre to compensate for the destruction of telecoms infrastructure by the fleeing Russian forces.Remnants of the Russian occupation, and of life in Ukraine before it, persist in the form of ripped-up Russian propaganda billboards and abandoned western and Ukrainian chain stores.The recently appointed new head of the Kherson region, Yaroslav Yanushevych, described how he was working to rebuild the administration from scratch, with a humanitarian crisis looming and Ukrainian military intelligence reports saying Russia could level the city as an act of revenge. “This is the biggest challenge of my life,” said Yanushevych, sporting black military fatigues.Yanushevych is new to the region. He is a career civil servant who has mostly been based in Kyiv. Before being appointed head of Kherson in August, he ran Ukraine’s state radio frequency centre.“All of our partners – the ICRC, the UN – say that no regional administration has faced a challenge like ours,” he said.Only 140 of 600 regional state employees left Kherson for Ukrainian-controlled territory. When he established an administration-in-exile under orders from the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, only a handful of members of staff were there to meet him. Most had rebuilt their lives elsewhere, he said.Yanushevych would not say how many Kherson administration employees became collaborators, or comment on their current whereabouts. Ukraine’s security services regularly publishes lists of Ukrainian officials who have collaborated with Russian occupation, including numerous former Kherson officials. In September, Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, unilaterally announced the annexation of four Ukrainian regions, even though his troops did not hold any of them entirely. The international community rejected the move.The occupation of Kherson region was particularly prized by Russia’s leadership as it created a land corridor and water supply for Crimea, the peninsula Russia annexed in 2014. Kherson, Putin declared at the time, was now Russian.But the state of Kherson’s regional administration building, which sits on the central square of the city, indicated there was little governance happening and it appeared to have been a low priority.Inside, the Ukrainian branding and signs for Kherson regional administration were still there, including in the governor’s own office. As were the Ukrainian national and patriotic artwork that lined the corridors.The floors were littered with small ash piles of burnt documents. Every room out of more than three dozen viewed by the Guardian was trashed and looted. There was women’s clothing in one room. On some desks there was uneaten food, including a half-eaten cabbage.A security service officer for Yanushevych, declared one room with a powerful stench a “Russian toilet”. Since the occupation, Russian soldiers have become infamous in Ukraine for using rooms as toilets in schools, factories and offices instead of the available toilets.But for Yanushevych, the mess inside his future office is fixable – his biggest challenge now is to reconnect the electricity supply. “Without electricity, the scale of the problems, like water, remains unresolvable,” he said.He said the Russians had purposefully destroyed all the substations and transformers surrounding the city when they left. The second power station that supplied the region is across the river in Russian-controlled territory and not functioning.Yanushevych hopes his administration will not have to deal with what will have to happen if it cannot provide the region with enough electricity. “[Evacuating residents] depends on whether there will be electricity. The president has said very clearly that we should throw all our resources into restoring the electricity supply,” he said. Mine clearers had to inspect each site before work could begin, which would take time, he said.Though noting there was no plan to evacuate residents, Mykhailo Lynetskiy, the head of Kherson district under the Kherson regional administration, had a more pessimistic take. Lynetskiy said that there would probably only be enough electricity to power the water system and for a limited number of residents. “As a Kherson city native, I categorically advise people to leave the city for safer places for the duration of the winter period,” he said.To add another layer to the surreal and difficult process of reintegrating Kherson’s residents into Ukraine after eight months of occupation – many of whom are living at rock bottom beneath the booming artillery being fired above their heads – prosecutors and police are gathering evidence of Russian war crimes and tracking down collaborators.Evidence of the systematic torture, disappearance and killing of civilians is already being documented.The majority of residents who welcomed the Russians have had plenty of time to escape but, according to the authorities, dozens of those who collaborated could still be hiding in Kherson. The Guardian saw one man being led down the street bound and blindfolded with tape. The escorting police officer said the man had been cleared of suspicion after someone reported him, but was being released away from the interrogation centre so he would not know its location.The real sense of euphoria about being back with Kyiv could still be felt one week after Ukrainian troops rolled into town. But it was mixed up with the extraordinary reality residents were forced to navigate under occupation, where no one knew what the future held. One middle-aged shopkeeper could be heard telling off her younger subordinate, “Just you wait, your parents are going get it. A week ago they were shouting ‘glory to Russia’, and now ‘glory to Ukraine’!”Yanushevych definitively ruled out working with collaborators. But, he said, he understood that most people stayed because they did not have the means to leave or were obliged to stay, for example, because of elderly or disabled relatives.“They were not police officers or soldiers. No one gave them the order to leave. I’m not going to judge them.”"
Traces of explosives found at sites of Nord Stream gas leaks,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/18/gross-sabotage-traces-of-explosives-found-at-sites-of-nord-stream-gas-leaks,"Traces of explosives have been found at the sites of September’s multiple leaks from the Nord Stream gas pipelines, confirming that the breaches were the result of sabotage, Sweden’s prosecution authority has said.“Analysis that has now been carried out shows traces of explosives on several of the objects that were recovered” from the scene in the Baltic Sea, Mats Ljungqvist, the prosecutor leading the investigation, said on Friday.Ljungqvist said the investigation was “very complex and comprehensive” and analysis would continue in order to draw “more reliable conclusions” and determine whether any suspects could be identified. But the evidence so far was of “gross sabotage”, he said.Swedish and Danish authorities are carrying out separate investigations into four ruptures in the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines, which carry gas between Russia and Germany via the Baltic, off the Danish island of Bornholm.Two of the leaks occurred in Denmark’s exclusive economic zone and two in Sweden’s. A 50-metre section was missing from Nord Stream 1, the Swedish daily Expressen reported last month after publishing footage filmed by an underwater drone.Seismologists in both countries recorded tremors in the area just before the leaks were reported that did not resemble those produced by earthquakes, and Denmark said last month that early indications pointed to “powerful explosions”.Scientists said the 26 September ruptures, described by experts as equivalent to several hundred kilograms of TNT, could have caused one of the worst natural gas leaks ever, spewing gas including methane – the biggest cause of climate heating after carbon dioxide – into the ocean that then bubbled to the surface.The pipelines have been at the centre of geopolitical tensions after Russia cut back its gas supplies to Europe, apparently in retaliation for sanctions imposed by the west in the wake of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.London last month dismissed allegations by Russia that the British navy was responsible for the blasts, saying the claims were designed to distract from Russian military failures in Ukraine. Washington and Moscow have denied any involvement.Ljungqvist said cooperation between the Swedish, Danish and other national authorities was “working excellently” and that no further information would be provided, to allow investigators to continue their work “in peace and quiet”.German authorities are carrying out their own investigation, in close cooperation with the Swedish and Danish teams, after Berlin’s offer of a formal joint investigation was rejected, reportedly over national security concerns."
"In liberated Kherson, Ukrainians are glimpsing victory after dark days",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/18/liberated-kherson-ukrainians-victory-russia-occupation,
Catch up with the must-read news and analysis,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/19/what-happened-in-the-russia-ukraine-war-this-week-catch-up-with-the-must-read-news-and-analysis,"Every week we wrap up the must-reads from our coverage of the Ukraine war, from news and features to analysis and opinion.A missile fell on the Polish village of Przewodów, landing a few miles from the Ukrainian border and killing two people on Tuesday afternoon. The incident marked the first time the territory of a Nato country has been struck during the near nine-month Ukraine war, raising global alarm that the war could spill into neighbouring countries.Emma Graham-Harrison travelled to the tiny Polish border village, which had been “trying as much as possible to keep life normal” until the tragedy underscored the proximity of the war. She found Father Bogdan Wazny, saying mass to an empty church.“The physical border here also mentally separated us from the war [in Ukraine]. We always felt this way,” Wazny says, the day after the missile landed. “We never felt the danger here.”“We [in Przewodów] managed to calm down after 24 February [when Russia invaded Ukraine] despite the fact that we live next door to the war,” says school principal Ewa Byra. “The emotions had subsided and we managed to cope. But yesterday’s event awakened those emotions again.”Earlier, Dan Sabbagh, Isobel Koshiw and Lorenzo Tondo covered the immediate aftermath of the devastation as Polish and Nato officials scrambled to confirm what had happened and to coordinate a response.Warsaw said it had summoned Moscow’s ambassador for an explanation but called for calm. Russia’s defence ministry denied its missiles crossed into Poland, calling the reports a “deliberate provocation”.Patrick Wintour covered Joe Biden’s briefing to reporters after an emergency meeting convened during G20 talks in Bali. Biden said the missile was unlikely to have been fired from Russia due to its trajectory.Jon Henley swept up the reaction across Europe as Andrzej Duda, the Polish president, said that it was “highly probable” the missile was fired by Ukrainian anti-aircraft defence and “unfortunately fell on Polish territory”.“Russia bears the ultimate responsibility,” Nato’s secretary general Jens Stoltenberg told reporters after an emergency meeting of alliance ambassadors in Brussels, adding that Russia was ultimately to blame for starting the war and launching the attack that triggered Kyiv’s defences.“The obvious point is that missiles were flying around yesterday because Russia was firing over 80 missiles into Ukraine,” British defence secretary, Ben Wallace, added.Russia battled to prevent diplomatic isolation at the G20 summit in Bali as its traditional allies – China and India – started to distance themselves from the war in Ukraine.In his address, Chinese president Xi Jinping warned against the “weaponisation” of food and energy, adding that he opposed nuclear war in all circumstances, remarks that cast a shadow over Russia’s repeated nuclear threats. “We must firmly oppose politicisation, instrumentalisation and weaponisation of food and energy problems,” Xi said.Indian prime minister Narendra Modi said it was necessary to recognise the UN had failed as a multilateral institution, putting greater pressure on the G20 to find solutions. He said it was time for a ceasefire and for diplomacy to come to the fore.While Russia’s representative, Sergei Lavrov, stayed in his hotel, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy addressed the summit by video link, pitching himself as a man prepared to reach an agreement with Russia but only on terms that protected Ukrainian sovereignty, and recognised the valour with which his troops had fought to protect their homeland.“I am convinced now is the time when the Russian destructive war must and can be stopped. It will save thousands of lives,” he said.Rishi Sunak told the G20 that Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, should have been prepared to face world leaders at the summit, because Russia leaving Ukraine would make “the single biggest difference” to world affairs.The British prime minister used his address to condemn the Ukraine invasion and the targeting of civilians and warned world leaders about the threat it posed to the international order. “One man has the power to change all of this,” Sunak told the summit, which was also addressed by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy.Patrick Wintour took a look at the “dysfunctional family” that is the G20 and found that behind-the-scenes negotiations on extending the grain deal allowing Russian and Ukrainian wheat to reach world markets was probably the most substantive achievement of the summit.Wintour also profiled foreign minister Lavrov – who has outlasted seven US secretaries of state and faced the toughest test of the veteran’s career as Putin’s punch-bag at the summit.Lorenzo Tondo and Luke Harding covered the moment the key southern city of Kherson was retaken by Ukrainian forces.Hundreds of citizens flooded the city streets on Saturday morning after an eight-month occupation, embracing Ukrainian soldiers and foreign journalists after what has been described as a “historic day” for Kyiv – and perhaps the most important strategic breakthrough since the beginning of the Russian invasion.In Kherson city, locals danced around a bonfire outside the regional administration building, sang patriotic songs, and chanted “Z-S-U”, the initials of Ukraine’s triumphant armed forces. Cars tooted their horns; citizens waved banners adorned with watermelons, the region’s much-loved fruit.People said that they could not quite believe it when they realised the occupation was over. The first sign that Ruslan Kalyn saw was a Ukrainian jeep, and he immediately ran home to tell his wife. “I can’t express the emotions that ran though me. I burst into tears. It was unbelievable euphoria. I went home and shouted ‘Marina, we’ve been liberated!’, but she didn’t believe me. I said ‘I’ve been on the square and seen our flag’,” he told Isobel Koshiw.The liberation of Kherson marks the latest, and most serious, of a string of battlefield defeats.Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced its recapture marked “the beginning of the end of the war” in a surprise visit to the city on Monday. Crowds chanted his name. Zelenskiy also accused Russian soldiers of war crimes and killing civilians in Kherson. “Investigators have already documented more than 400 Russian war crimes. Bodies of dead civilians and servicemen have been found. The Russian army left behind the same savagery it did in other regions of the country it entered,” the Ukrainian president said.Ukraine’s swift recapture of Kherson sets the stage for a critical phase in the war, Dan Sabbagh, wrote.Ukraine’s success in Kherson was a victory achieved by smashing the Russian supply chain, concluded with US Himars artillery and aided by favourable geography – the isolated position of Kherson on the west of the Dnipro.However the Zaporizhzhia front to the east is essentially a straight line across open country that has not moved for months, so in theory Moscow’s forces should be well dug in. Russia’s other advantage is that it has called up what it says are 300,000 conscripts, a third of whom are at the front.The winter weather will also make the situation more complicated for both sides.In this week’s Today in Focus episode, Luke Harding asked whether Ukraine can build on the momentum of its win to turn the tide.Luke Harding recounted the surreal time, nine months ago, when it seemed like surely Putin was bluffing.“It was the evening before everything changed,” he writes in a Guardian Long Read. “The Ukrainian novelist Andrey Kurkov had invited me for dinner. A few friends, he said, and borshch. We had met earlier that winter – a pleasant meal in a Georgian restaurant in Podil, a neighbourhood in the lower part of Kyiv next to the Dnipro River. The date was now 23 February 2022. It was 8.15pm, and I was late. I stopped in a shop, bought a bottle of Kolonist port from a winery in Odesa, and hurried to Kurkov’s flat.”After a 32-month trial, a Dutch court found three men guilty of the murder of 298 people onboard flight MH17, which was shot down by a Russian surface-to-air missile when it was flying over eastern Ukraine in 2014. Jennifer Rankin covered the sentencing.Martin Farrer spoke to the mother of one of the victims, who expressed her relief after the guilty verdicts were read out in a court. Meryn O’Brien, who lost her 25-year-old son Jack, said: “Everyone was relieved the process has come to an end, and it is very fair, and it has been meticulous.”"
Talks continue over EU climate loss and damage fund proposal,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/18/cop27-talks-continue-over-eu-climate-loss-and-damage-fund-proposal,"Crucial climate talks have dragged on past their deadline with no end in sight, as governments wrangle over how to pay for the rebuilding of poor countries ravaged by climate breakdown.There was turmoil in the negotiating halls of the Cop27 UN summit in Egypt. Delegates rushed from room to room as countries scrambled to decide their response to a last-ditch proposal from the European Union that would establish a new fund providing cash for countries suffering climate-related disaster, known as loss and damage.Such a fund has been the core demand of developing countries during the two weeks of these negotiations. But the EU’s offer came with conditions attached that forced developing countries into a quandary.Frans Timmermans, vice-president of the European Commission, said EU member states would only provide cash if “the donor base was broadened”.That means expecting payments – and tougher targets on cutting greenhouse gases – from countries such as China, the world’s biggest emitter and second-biggest economy, as well as high emitters with vast oil revenues such as Saudi Arabia and Russia, and potentially from rapidly industrialising nations such as South Korea and Singapore.Those countries have all been classed as “developing” since the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, parent treaty to the Paris agreement, was signed in 1992. That has meant they have been absolved from contributing to climate finance for the vulnerable, and many have lax targets on cutting emissions.But in the past 30 years, their emissions and economies have ballooned. China’s cumulative emissions are now second only to those of the US, while Russia, India, Indonesia and Brazil are also in the top ten.China did not respond to requests for a response. Last week, the country’s climate chief, Xie Zhenhua, indicated that China did not face an obligation to pay for loss and damage in vulnerable countries.“We strongly support the concerns from developing countries, especially the most vulnerable countries, for addressing loss and damage because China is also a developing country and we also suffered a lot from extreme weather events,” he said, through a translator. “It is not the obligation of China to provide financial support under the UNFCCC.”Some vulnerable nations warmly welcomed the EU proposal. Seve Paeniu, finance minister for the low-lying Pacific island nation of Tuvalu, said it was a “major breakthrough”. Vanuatu and Palau took similar positions. “To me, that is a major concession,” Paeniu said. “It is our hope that it will be ending up in the text of the conference decision.”Others gave a muted or ambivalent response to the EU proposal, even though they had been calling for the establishment of a loss and damage fund. Many poorer developing countries have traditionally sought to present a united front with China, which has offered investment to economies in Africa, Latin America and south-east Asia.Carla Barnett, secretary general of the Caribbean Community group of countries, said: “There’s only one option for small island developing states, a financing fund that delivers a just pathway for the future of our countries. Division and delay tactics will not work. This is a matter we defend on the basis of justice.”Many others would not respond officially, but the Guardian understands that some are pleased at the EU proposal but will not speak out for fear of angering their allies. Civil society activists and some countries accused the EU of trying to create division in the developing world.Mohamed Adow, director of the Power Shift Africa thinktank, said: “The fund shouldn’t be used as a poison pill to fix old divisions around expanding the donor base. [This] won’t meet the needs of vulnerable countries.”One negotiator for the G77 plus China alliance told the Guardian: “It is a predictable attempt by the EU to break up the G77 in talks. Of course, it’s not a breakthrough. It’s completely disingenuous.”Timmermans denied those claims. “I’m doing this for my kids,” he said. “We can’t afford to have a failure. If our steps forward are not reciprocated by others, there will be a failure. I hope that can be avoided.”It is unclear whether the US will support the EU proposal, and a state department spokesperson declined to comment, citing active/ongoing negotiations. Several other developed countries including Australia and Canada have welcomed it.As well as the EU proposal, the frantic last official day of the fortnight-long talks saw:"
US shamed as the ‘colossal fossil’ of Cop27 climate summit by campaigners,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/18/us-shamed-as-the-colossal-fossil-of-cop27-climate-summit-by-campaigners,"The US has been named the “colossal fossil” of the Cop27 climate talks by campaigners who criticised the country for its intransigence in providing support to developing countries hit hardest by the climate crisis.The “award”, unveiled at a ceremony featuring a person dressed as a dinosaur, is an annual event staged by Climate Action Network International to shame the countries deemed to be blocking climate progress.The US took this year’s unwanted title for so far failing to back the creation of a new “loss and damage” fund, tentatively backed by the European Union, that would provide money to poorer countries suffering severe climate impacts.John Kerry, the US climate envoy, has said the US is open to discussing the idea over the next two years, although it is wary of opening itself up to any sort of liability for the damages its huge historical emissions have caused.“Sadly, the US traded its supposed climate ambition for some dino-sized hypocrisy at this summit,” said Jean Su, energy justice director at the Center for Biological Diversity. Su said that the US has not only blocked loss and damage financing but is pushing ahead with new gas infrastructure on the Gulf of Mexico coast.“In these closing hours of Cop27 the US can still show its climate chops, commit to a loss and damage fund and push for a fossil fuel phaseout in the final text,” she added.“Dishonourable mentions” in the awards went to Russia for bringing a large contingent of fossil fuel lobbyists and to the “climate disaster” caused by Brazil under the outgoing government of Jair Bolsonaro. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Bolsonaro’s successor as Brazilian president, has, however, received a largely warm welcome from activists at Cop27 due to his promises to stamp out deforestation in the Amazon."
What has changed since the first draft?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2022/nov/18/second-draft-of-cop27-text-what-has-changed-since-the-first-draft,"At 10 pages, this second draft of the Cop27 cover text is just half the length of the previous version, which will come as a relief to negotiators. Many of the ramblings and repetitions of the previous version have been removed or tidied up, but some key points have been weakened or left out.There is still a commitment to phase down coal power, but the wider commitment to a phase down of all fossil fuels sought by India and others has been taken out.On the 1.5C temperature limit, many countries were hoping for much stronger language that would reflect the advances made at Cop26 in Glasgow last year to “keep 1.5C alive”.And on loss and damage – the vexed issue of how to provide financial assistance to poor countries suffering the worst ravages of climate breakdown – there is little of substance because countries are still fiercely debating the possibility of a new fund, proposed by the EU in the early hours of Friday.This text has a long way to go, and while the tightening that has been done by the Egyptian hosts is welcome, the lack of substantial commitments and forthright language in some key areas will disappoint many.The principle of common but differentiated responsibilities is a key phrase. It refers to the fact that the cumulative greenhouse gas emissions from most developing countries are far smaller than those from the developed world. This weaker wording takes the place of an attempt to include strong language on diets, which were excised at the behest of the US.The biodiversity Cop15 will take place next month, where the links between species loss and climate breakdown will also come to the fore. Why not a stronger message of support for Cop15?This language on sticking to the 1.5C temperature limit, which was the focus of Cop26, is still not as strong as some had hoped.This is weaker language than in the G20 communique earlier this week, which reaffirmed the 1.5C temperature limit, not the Paris agreement which includes a 2C upper limit.The call to avoid backsliding is still in the text, but in a limited way, applying only to the support that is supposed to come from developed countries to help poorer ones. A call to avoid backsliding on other key elements, such as cutting greenhouse gas emissions, is notably missing.This language will disappoint many. India led an attempt, with the backing of the EU and the US, to include the phase down of all fossil fuels, not just coal, in this draft. That appears to have been removed. The call for a phase down of unabated coal power is the same as what finally appeared in the cover text from Cop26, when a phase out of coal was weakened to a phase down at the last minute by India and China. More repetition of the 2C upper goal of the Paris agreement – technically, this correctly reflects the language of the Paris agreement, but it leaves loopholes for those who want to unpick the promises to stick to 1.5C made in Glasgow.Stronger language on 1.5C here, which is good but not enough.This language appears weaker than in the last draft, which requested “all parties to revisit and strengthen 2030 NDCs to align with 1.5C” and to update them “regularly” in line with the latest science. That was the “ratchet” agreed in Glasgow, which was supposed to mean that countries would return every year with better nationally determined contributions until they were all aligned with 1.5C. To lose the ratchet would be serious backsliding.This section of the draft text, on loss and damage, was overtaken by events even before it was published, as the EU made its proposal in the early hours of Friday for a fund for loss and damage. Parties are still debating that proposal, so this placeholder text looks certain to remain in situ, perhaps until the final draft.This is good because many developing countries would like to emulate South Africa and Indonesia, which have gained billions of dollars in funding to help them move workers from coal to renewable energy and low-carbon jobs.These seem like huge numbers, but are not much bigger than the investment needed to develop in a high-carbon economy. The impetus to reform the development banks and reduce the cost of capital investment in poor countries is growing.Much of the climate finance that currently flows to developing countries comes in the form of loans, with high interest rates and repayment requirements. Countries already facing a debt mountain cannot afford to take on more. One of the key aims of reforming the World Bank and other development banks is to remedy this.At Glasgow, more than 20 forested nations agreed to reverse deforestation by 2030. The lack of a deadline here shows that not all forested nations have agreed to that goal. There were 12 references to the global stocktake in the last draft of this text; here there is only one, and it comes without a date. Next year’s global stocktake is a major requirement of the Paris agreement, requiring an assessment of countries’ progress on their emissions goals. It is the main way of checking that the Paris agreement is working as intended, and will be one of the key outcomes next year at Cop28 in Dubai, so it is odd that it is not receiving greater emphasis.Was there pressure to bring the document down to less than 100 paragraphs? It is still a long text, and further editing can be expected."
EU reversal of stance on loss and damage turns tables on China at Cop27,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/18/eu-reversal-stance-loss-damage-china-cop27,
"Rupert’s papers kick Donald, but Fox won’t play ball",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/nov/18/murdoch-v-trump-ruperts-papers-kick-donald-but-fox-wont-play-ball,"Rupert Murdoch’s newspapers don’t do subtlety when it comes to political attacks.Over the last week, readers of his US titles have been informed that Donald Trump is “Trumpty Dumpty”, the “biggest loser” in Republican politics, and the man who meant the “red wave” never crested in the US midterm elections.The New York Post marked Trump’s latest bid for election with something more damning: outright mockery.Under the headline: “Florida Man makes announcement,” the formerly pro-Trump newspaper directed readers to a story deep inside the newspaper on page 28.“With just 720 days to go before the next election, a Florida retiree made the surprise announcement Tuesday night that he was running for president,” said the deadpan news report.The tabloid’s print edition has a dwindling readership but the former US president is still said to be a regular reader – which means it probably hurt when they mocked his Mar-a-Lago home – raided by the FBI in August – as a “classified documents library”.Yet while the newspaper editorials have led to suggestions that Murdoch has completed a clean break with the former US president, this misses the more positive reaction on Murdoch’s Fox News television channel.“Murdoch has very little control over his most important outlet, which is Fox,” said Michael Wolff, the media commentator who has written three books on Trump.“Let’s assume Murdoch was giving a message to the Post … he can’t do that at Fox. And Fox is the all-important thing.”Although there has been criticism of Trump on Fox News in recent weeks, several presenters such as Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson have their own loyal audiences who have been fed pro-Trump material for years. A rapid U-turn may be too much for them to take, especially if the network is accused of betrayal.As Wolff puts it: “Each of the voices at Fox is going to be motivated by their own ratings – and if their own ratings are dependent on Trump then they’re not going to deviate. Hannity does not seem to have deviated one increment off his absolute fealty to Trump. Tucker likewise.”In the background is Murdoch’s attempt to reunite two parts of his business empire and ultimately hand over control to his 51-year-old son, Lachlan. The family’s main media interests are separated into two businesses as a result of the News of the World phone-hacking scandal, which saw the legally troubled outlets separated.The core business is the US-focused television business Fox, while the newspaper assets – including its UK titles – are controlled by News Corp.Combining the two makes little business sense but would tidy up family succession planning, according to the media analyst Alice Enders: “It’s not about Rupert being back in charge, it’s about Lachlan taking over and pursuing the same traditional classic conservative agenda.”She said that it would be hard for Fox News to find a way to let go of Trump without risking some of the hundreds of millions of dollars of advertising that flows to the network.“Fox is the jewel in the crown. The influence that the Murdochs want to exercise is through Fox News. What’s super interesting is they want to maintain their currency as the go-to news channel for conservative voters – and they have to do that in a way that balances the Trumpistas against everyone.”The focus on US politics also reflects a physical change in Rupert Murdoch’s location.He has spent a substantial time in the UK in recent years alongside his now ex-wife Jerry Hall and his daughter Elisabeth.During the Covid pandemic they were based at an Oxfordshire mansion, where he took the decision to sign up Piers Morgan for the launch of TalkTV and went to get his Covid vaccine – at the same time that his US media outlets were casting doubts on its effectiveness.Now the recently divorced nonagenarian is increasingly based at a newly acquired ranch in rural Montana, a remote state favoured by billionaires. Official documents show that last month he paid £13,000 to fly the former prime minister Boris Johnson there for a meeting, while corporate filings suggest he is running his business empire from the ranch and has permission to hold board meetings there.This raises the question of which Murdoch is now calling the shots: 91-year-old Rupert or Lachlan, who is managing part of the business from his family home in Australia – working late into the night on video calls due to the time difference.The Trump years weighed heavily on Murdoch, with Fox News facing a $1.6bn lawsuit over claims it amplified Trump’s false allegations about fraud at a voting machine company after his election defeat. Murdoch’s son James has left the family business and had made barely coded criticisms of Fox News, which hit hard according to Wolff.“In terms of Rupert himself, he has always detested Trump. Trump has been the cross to bear in his life, and the Trump effect at Fox has essentially broken up his family.”Trump, banned from Twitter and struggling to get airtime, has not taken his ostracism lightly, whining that they were favouring Florida governor Ron DeSantis.“NewsCorp – which is Fox, the Wall Street Journal and the no longer great New York Post – is all in for Governor Ron DeSanctimonious,” Trump said.But as Enders puts it: “Murdoch doesn’t back losers. Trump is a loser.”"

What do we know so far about the crypto exchange's collapse?,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/18/how-did-crypto-firm-ftx-collapse,"The collapse of FTX, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has unleashed another bout of volatility in the highly speculative digital asset market. The fortune of FTX’s founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, went from nearly $16bn to zero within days as his crypto empire filed for bankruptcy protection in the US on 11 November. Here we answer some of your questions about the story so far.In corporate terms, FTX was a chaotic web of more than 100 different companies, all united under the common ownership of Bankman-Fried and his co-founders, Gary Wang and Nishad Singh. In a bankruptcy filing, John Ray III – an American bankruptcy specialist who previously oversaw the collapse of Enron – described it as four main “silos”: a venture capital arm, which invested in other businesses; a hedge fund, which traded crypto for profit; and two exchanges, one supposedly ringfenced and regulated for the US audience, and one international exchange where the rules were much freer.The revenue streams were as diverse as the business, but the core of the group was the exchange. Most people buy cryptocurrency by transferring money (“fiat”) to an exchange like FTX, which operates like a bureau de change, trading currency pairs at a floating exchange rate. FTX’s regulated exchange offered that service, and the company took a cut of every transaction, but the big bucks were in the much more aggressive trading on the international exchange, where traders would try to profit from swings in the prices of crypto assets, borrowing money to increase their potential earnings (or losses). The more complex the trade, the bigger the cut.In the short term, because of a token called FTT. This was effectively a share in FTX, that the company issued itself and promised to buy back using a portion of its profits. But documents leaked to news site CoinDesk suggested that Alameda, the group’s hedge fund, was using FTT to make risky loans – effectively trading using company scrip. The revelation prompted a major holder of FTT, rival exchange Binance, to declare it was selling its holdings, prompting a run on the exchange as other customers scrambled to withdraw their funds.In the medium term, it collapsed because of deeper issues to do with the link between FTX and Alameda. The exchange didn’t have the ability to accept wire transfers, so customers would send money to Alameda, and FTX would credit their accounts. But the actual money was never passed on: three years later, Alameda had kept hold of, traded with, and frequently lost, $8bn of FTX customer funds. When the run on the exchange started, FTX couldn’t find the money it thought it had, because it had never taken it.In the long term, FTX failed because the company was a mess. “Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here,” said Ray, the bankruptcy specialist.Within the sector, different conclusions have been drawn. Some have argued the collapse is a triumph for “decentralised finance”, or DeFi, which uses computer code to build versions of financial services that don’t rely on trust or a central party. The head of a DeFi exchange can’t buy a $40m penthouse with customer funds because there is no head.But outside the sector, the conclusion is plain. Cryptocurrencies are a bet on the idea that a world where government power over money and finance is ended would be a better one: the collapse of FTX is perfect evidence that actually, government regulations over finance are pretty useful.Some people will get some money back, but no one is going to get everything. Even Bankman-Fried is convinced that it would take an $8bn injection of capital to make every depositor whole. But the accounts presented by Ray make clear that is wishful thinking. There isn’t even a single document detailing all the company’s depositors, he says, and while the balance sheet suggests a healthy mixture of assets and liabilities, “I do not have confidence in it and the information therein may not be correct as of the date stated”.Robert Frenchman, a partner at New York law firm Mukasey Frenchman, said FTX customers in the US whose money is trapped in the failed business will have to join a queue of creditors because there are no special protections for customers of unregistered crypto firms like FTX.“There is no backstop here for customers in the US, unlike for bank or brokerage account holders. The customers will have to fight it out with everyone else because they have no special protections. They go into this process as individual creditors, or as a group of creditors if they band together, who must battle it out with legions of other creditors, large and small.”In the meantime, the US attorney’s office for the southern district of New York is reportedly looking into the case and US treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, has said that crypto markets need more robust oversight.There have already been signs of a spillover effect. BlockFi, a crypto lender rescued by FTX in the summer, has paused customer withdrawals, admitting that it has “significant exposure to FTX”. On Wednesday, the crypto exchange Genesis “made the difficult decision to temporarily suspend redemptions” from the company’s lending business after a series of withdrawals from the service.This week the chief executive of the Singapore-based crypto exchange Crypto.com said his firm would prove wrong all those who said the platform was in trouble, adding that it had a robust balance sheet and took no risks. Kris Marszalek made the statement after investors questioned the transfer of $400m-worth of ether tokens from Crypto.com to another exchange called Gate.io on 21 October. Marszalek said the transfer was an error and the ether tokens had been returned to the exchange.Crypto market watchers expect more instability, although the core crypto asset, bitcoin, has held up this week by staying broadly flat at about $16,700.Teunis Brosens, head of regulatory analysis at Dutch bank ING, said the crisis would “surely deepen” the latest crypto winter, which has resulted in the value of the crypto market falling from $3tn last year to less than $1tn now.“In terms of prices, we saw bitcoin quite stable around $19,000-$20,000 for months. I’d consider it likely that we will now be seeking stability at lower levels – but first, the storm has to subside, and we are definitely not there yet.”"

Could Twitter collapse or go bankrupt?,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/18/could-twitter-collapse-or-go-bankrupt-elon-musk,"Elon Musk’s reaction on Friday to the latest wave of chaos to hit Twitter was to tweet a picture of the company’s logo superimposed over a gravestone. Former Twitter staff are wondering if the problems at the company are indeed existential.Since the Tesla chief executive took over last month, the company has been hit by swingeing job cuts, an advertiser boycott, warnings of bankruptcy and now a mass resignation among its remaining staff.No wonder the topics trending on Twitter this morning included #RIPTwitter and #TwitterMigration as the turmoil worsened.Here we answer some questions about the scale of the crisis.Musk fired approximately half of the 7,500-strong workforce in the first week of November, within days of taking over. This left about 3,750 workers. Overnight an unspecified number of those employees left after Musk set them a 5pm ET deadline on Thursday to accept “long hours at high intensity” and being “extremely hardcore” or else leave with three months’ severance pay. According to one report, 75% chose severance, which would leave less than 1,000 employees at Twitter.The departures have affected a range of departments, including the press team, which means queries about the scale of cuts and impact on the platform are now going unanswered. Instead, former employees are filling the gap.Evidence on social media pointed to a number of engineers leaving in the wake of Musk’s ultimatum, despite Twitter’s new owner stressing that the new-look company would be “much more engineering-driven” under his ownership and that “those writing great code will constitute the majority of our team”.There are now concerns that the site will be vulnerable to technical failures and bugs, amid signs that the complex system underpinning Twitter is already creaking. Two-factor authentication has already been affected and there have been issues with retweeting.Steven Murdoch, a professor of security engineering at University College London, said the platform might struggle to handle “complex failures”, carry out manual maintenance or tackle security threats. Simply replacing departed engineers will be difficult. “Twitter could try to hire new staff or retask existing staff, but getting up to speed about how the relevant systems work can take months, even with a smooth handover process. Every large website has developed their own unique system and anyone coming from outside will have a steep learning curve.”Even before Musk arrived, there had been signs of problems. Twitter’s former head of security, Peiter Zatko, has warned that information security standards were poor. He feared Twitter could suffer an “Equifax-level” hack, referring to the 2017 attack on a credit reporting company that exposed the data of 147 million people in the US.Musk warned this month the company could go bust, saying without a rise in subscription revenue it might not survive the forthcoming recession. Advertising accounts for 90% of Twitter’s $5.1bn (£4.3bn) in annual revenue but that revenue source has been hit hard by a pause in spending by major clients including General Motors and the company behind the cereal brands Cheerios and Lucky Charms. Musk confirmed that there had been a “massive drop” in ad revenue in the wake of the takeover.The financial problems – Twitter has made a loss for 10 of the past 12 years – have been compounded by a muddled relaunch of the subscription service, Twitter Blue, which has been paused after impersonators jumped on the offer to be “verified” by simply paying $7.99 a month. That would be very serious for Twitter. The company has added nearly $13bn of debt to its balance sheet following the takeover and it carries interest costs of about $1bn a year. One measure of a company’s ability to pay those costs is its cashflow. According to Twitter’s last set of quarterly results as a listed company, Twitter generated negative free cashflow (spending more cash to run the business than it takes in) of nearly $124m.Farhad Divecha, managing director of UK digital marketing agency Accuracast, said fears over “brand safety” on Twitter were already a concern among advertisers. Now they will be worried about the quality of service they will be getting from Twitter staff, he added.“Staff disfranchisement is obviously looking like a problem. And even if Elon didn’t want to negatively impact ad services, as the agency handling advertisers budgets, we are concerned about the quality of service we get from Twitter ad support and the account managers at Twitter who service our agency account and our clients’ accounts,” he said."

Public sector workers react to autumn statement,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/18/public-sector-workers-autumn-statement-nhs-strikes,"Britain is facing the biggest hit to living standards on record after Jeremy Hunt announced sweeping tax rises and spending cuts heralding a fresh wave of austerity. Meanwhile, the public sector has seen pay growth fall behind that of the private sector at the sharpest rate on record.The chancellor offered an additional £3.3bn for the NHS and £2.3bn for schools a year and a real-terms increase for government departments, albeit at a slower rate. Here workers from those sectors react to his autumn statement, suggesting the sums fall short of what is needed to meet spiralling costs and avert strikes.Nancy Budler, 53, who has taught at her secondary school in West Yorkshire for 26 years, says Hunt’s budget “is still not focused on education enough. Funding pay awards along with energy costs and inflation will still make it very difficult to balance the books.”Budler backs the National Education Union taking strike action. “I’m a committed teacher who loves her school. I would not strike if it was not necessary … We have no choice if we wish to protect both teachers and our schools and pupils.”She says teachers’ pay awards must not come from school budgets. “Schools are faced with a number of competing factors, including rising energy costs and food inflation. You have to ask – we’re not a profit-making organisation, that money comes from the students.”She says using school cash to fund salary increases would leave her unable to buy textbooks for the department she heads. “This isn’t fair and it isn’t right. The government makes a political choice to not fund our pay.”“I’m hoping for government-funded, inflation-linked pay rises that will support teachers to remain in this increasingly challenging profession. Private business talks about high wages attracting the very best into the field – how do they expect to get the best teachers and keep us in the field?”David, a 30-year-old civil servant in Sheffield, has seen his savings depleted “down to zero” by inflation and the cost of living crisis and believes Hunt’s budget “will only make that worse”.“The support for bills is not good enough, and the windfall tax on energy companies is pitiful given their massive profits,” he says. “Halts to planned increases to tax-free amounts are unwelcome – when there are plenty of extra ways tax could have been raised on high earners without hitting everyone.”The 30-year-old says civil service pay must rise in line with inflation. “The below-inflation pay rises in the civil service have meant for me that things have got more expensive and the amount I have left at the end of each month once I’ve paid my mortgage and loans has dropped.“The only way for anyone to achieve a meaningful pay rise in the civil service is to get promoted. For many, however, they’re not interested or capable of taking on the extra responsibility of promotion, meaning the most junior grades find themselves earning less each year in real terms.” David hopes strikes by the Public and Commercial Services Union will make the government take notice. “Central government civil servants are often forgotten about where nurses and teachers make the news. They certainly deserve better pay, but so do we. I’m hoping for a commitment to increase pay in line with inflation, and a one-off increase to offset pay lost over the last decade. PCS is asking for more than that, but that is the minimum we should expect.”Alex, a 31-year-old emergency department nurse in a hospital in south-west England, was pleased to hear Hunt commit to an increase in social care funding to ease discharging issues in hospitals. “It will hopefully [mean] more hospital beds and reduce the stress on the ambulances and emergency departments.”The extra £3.3bn announced by Hunt for the NHS is less than half the £7bn that bosses say it requires. “He’s not said how it’s going to be used or invested,” Alex says. “He also didn’t mention how he planned to avoid [nurses striking] or how he planned to support the nurses so this leaves the future feeling very uncertain.”Alex, who is a band 6 nurse and an RCN member, says she supports the union’s strike “because nurses aren’t paid enough for what we do … Nurses every day are struggling – [especially] the band fives, the ones on the shop floor doing the grunt work of the NHS, doing 12-hour shifts. They can’t afford to live. For what we have to deal with every day on shift, it’s not right.”She says understaffing on wards means nurses are overworked and face burnout. “Staffing is just getting worse and worse – when I first qualified you had up to eight patients on a ward, now it’s up to 14. You don’t get breaks – I won’t even get a drink or use the toilet until I get home,” she says.“When I started there was a lot more support. Now a lot can’t continue with the profession and leave early because of burnout. We save lives and we don’t even get a decent wage for all the hard work we do.”"
"How it will impact households, from single mums to married pensioners",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/18/autumn-statement-2022-what-it-means-for-you,"The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, has pressed the button on a new wave of austerity in an autumn statement that will bring to an end eight years of improved living standards.Hunt left the three main tax rates unchanged – 20p basic, 40p higher and 45p additional rate – with the first £12,750 of income tax-free and the 40% rate starting at £50,270. However, he did lower the threshold at which Britons start paying the 45p top rate of income tax to £125,140 – a measure that will pull 250,000 people into the top rate.In the 2021 spring budget, the then chancellor, Rishi Sunak, set up a four-year freeze on personal tax thresholds that began in April. Over time, this drags more low-income households into paying basic-rate tax (which kicks in at £12,570) and those with earnings nearing £50,000 into the higher 40% rate. Now Hunt has gone even further, by prolonging this deep freeze for a further two years, meaning no change until 2028.However, the state pension and benefits will rise 10.1% from April, in line with September’s inflation rate, and the “national living wage” for over-23s will increase from £9.50 an hour to £10.42.This budget was short on good news for Britons struggling with higher food, energy and borrowing costs. The chancellor is also making it easier to raise council tax by 5% in a bid to bolster local authorities’ finances, which will add to the squeeze on household budgets next year.Genevieve Morris, the head of corporate tax at Blick Rothenberg, described it as a budget that “boils the frog”. “The continued freezing of tax thresholds means most people won’t notice it directly as the temperature increases, and so won’t leap out of the water. They’ll simply discover years down the line that they boiled.”This is how the autumn statement announcement will impact different households.Earns £38,0002022/23 She earns the national average wage of £38,000 and pays £5,084 a year in income tax and a national insurance bill of £3,248. Her monthly take-home pay is £2,489 after tax. She also got £400 help from the government with her energy bill.2023/24 The frozen tax thresholds won’t have any immediate impact on take-home salary and her annual national insurance bill goes down by £196 after this year’s hike in contributions was cancelled halfway through the year. There will be no energy bill subsidy for all this year, and she faces a higher bills because the price cap has increased by £500 to £3,000. Overall, she is £200 worse off.Earns £11,ooo2022/23 Her low salary means she does not have to pay income tax or national insurance, so takes home £917 a month. She gets £680 in universal credit payments a month and £144 child benefit. She received a £650 cost of living payment.2023/24 Her take-home pay is unchanged by the autumn statement. She will get £800 universal credit and £160 of child benefit. As she claims means-tested benefits, she will receive the £900 cost of living payment. Overall, she is £1,882 better off.First income £55,000, second income £35,0002022/23 Our couple pay a total of £13,913 in income tax and £7,763 in national insurance each year. This results in a combined monthly income of £5,694 after tax.2023/24 The autumn statement announcement does not change how much income tax this couple has to pay. Again their national insurance bill will fall, meaning they are £453 better off until they get a pay rise to cover galloping inflation, pushing up their tax bill. They also lose the £400 energy bill support.One income of £23,000, with partner a full-time carer2022/23 The breadwinner’s take home pay is £1,639 a month after tax. They qualify for £756 universal credit, £145 child benefit and £279 carer’s allowance each month. The disability living allowance for their child is £628 a month, and they received an £800 cost of living payment. This resulted in a total income of £42,164.2023/24 The family’s monthly benefit payments will increase. They will get £954 in universal credit, £160 child benefit, £308 carer’s allowance and £692 disability living allowance. The family will also receive a £1,050 cost of living payment. This adds up to £46,086.One income of £57,0002022/23 The working parent pays £9,976 a year in income tax and £4,934 in national insurance. This translates into a monthly income of £3,508 plus £60.84 a month in child benefit.2023/24 This family will see an increase in the amount of child benefit they receive, rising £1.53 to £16.74 a week or £67 a month. Their national insurance bill is reduced by £275 to £4,658. If they earned less than £50,000, they would be able to keep all their child benefit. Overall, they are £355 better off.2022/23 The couple receive £880 of universal credit and a combined personal independence payment (Pip) of £243 every month, as well as an £800 cost of living payment.2023/24 The couple will get £1,050 in cost of living payments due to their disabilities and the fact that they claim means-tested benefits. Their universal credit payment will increase to £969 a month, and their Pip will rise to £268. Overall, they are £1,681 better off.First income £150,000, second income £85,0002022/23 This high-earning couple pay £73,888 income tax each year, and £12,791 in national insurance contributions, which were higher for the first part of the financial year. Their combined take-home pay each month is £12,360.2023/24 After the budget, their income tax bill rises by £1,243 to reflect the lowering of the rate at which additional rate tax is paid to £125,000. This increases the couple’s income tax bill to £75,131, but their national insurance contributions are £1054 lower at £11,737, leaving their income virtually unchanged.2022/23 His state pension is £141.85 a week or £567 a month and he also gets the pension credit top-up worth £40.75 a week, or £163. He qualified for £950 of cost of living payments.2023/24 This pensioner will benefit from the 10.1% benefits uplift. He will now get £156 basic state pension a week, or £624 a month, and a £179 pension credit top-up. He will receive cost of living payments worth £1,200. Overall, he is £1,209 better off.State pension plus £8,000 private pension2022/23 One half of this couple gets a basic state pension of £142 a week, plus a private pension of £154 a week. The other has a weekly state pension of £85. They pay income tax of £307 on the private pension and received a £300 cost of living payment.2023/24 They are £1,044 a year better off after the autumn statement, due to the rise in the state pension. They will also receive another £300 cost of living payment.One is a small company director whose company makes £40,000 after expenses. She takes a salary of £9,100, pays corporation tax on the remainder and receives dividend payments of £25,029. Her wife is a teacher earning £30,000.2022/23 The couple pays £3,484 income tax on the teacher’s salary, £2,254 national insurance, £5,871 corporation tax and £1,957 income tax on dividends. They have take-home pay of £56,433 a year.2023/24 Changes to the dividend tax rule mean the couple are worse off as they have to pay £2,042 income tax on company dividends. The teacher’s national insurance bill drops to £2,092, so their combined income is virtually unchanged, at £56,511 a year."
"Hunt’s budget will mean 19 years of wage stagnation, warns thinktank",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/18/uk-workers-will-miss-out-on-pay-rises-worth-15000-over-next-five-years-autumn-statement,"Jeremy Hunt’s autumn statement will result in extending wage stagnation for Britain’s workers to two decades as the chancellor’s tax-heavy budget piles more pressure on the nation’s “squeezed middle”, a thinktank said.The Resolution Foundation said on Friday that the dire economic outlook meant that real wages were not expected to return to 2008 levels until 2027.Hunt’s austerity budget will extend the real wage recovery lag to 19 years. If pay had continued to grow at the same rate as before the financial crisis hit in 2008, then by 2027, workers would be £292 a week – or £15,000 annually – better off.Figures published alongside Jeremy Hunt’s autumn statement on Thursday by the Office for Budget Responsibility said the UK was in a recession that would wipe out eight years of growth, with British households set to face the biggest fall in living standards since records began.The Resolution Foundation said Hunt had put further pressure on the “squeezed middle”, with the autumn statement set to bring about a permanent 3.7% income hit to typical households.It said the move to maintain a boost benefits in line with inflation next year represented the biggest rise since 1991, making a huge difference to those on low-to-middle incomes. Households on universal credit will receive a boost of £244 on average next year.However, the scaling back of support for soaring energy bills next April will mean that the government will help households offset only 30% of the rises expected over the next two years.About one in eight families – 3.3m homes in total – will be paying more than £2,000 more for energy than they did last year.However, the poorest fifth of UK households will be covered for 48% of the expected rises because of the government’s targeted lump sum payments plan.“As an energy importer during an energy price shock, Britain is getting poorer,” said James Smith, a research director at the Resolution Foundation. “Deciding how we do so was, to a significant extent, the choice facing the chancellor. He has decided that households will do so with higher energy bills, higher taxes and worse public services than previously expected. Whether or not making the choices was tough, the reality of living through the next few years will be.”Speaking on Friday morning, Hunt said: “People will feel like even despite the hardship they can do things like go to the pub. We want people to feel the government is helping them through the recession. There is a plan, we’ll get through it, bring inflation down and growth the economy healthily when we get to the other side.”"
Find out how UK price rises affect you,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/nov/16/personal-inflation-calculator-uk-price-rises-2022,"Inflation is soaring in the UK as people are hit by higher prices for everyday essentials.Now in double digits, the latest inflation rate for the 12 months to October 2022 means that goods and services cost over 11.1% more than they did a year ago – in most cases, surpassing any pay rises workers can expect to receive. However, you could have a different, personal inflation rate depending on what you typically buy each month. This is because some items have gone up by more in price than others.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has built a personal inflation calculator, allowing you to see what inflation looks like for your household.

Landlord’s position in doubt after Awaab Ishak’s parents demand accountability,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/nov/18/landlord-of-rochdale-flat-in-which-awaab-ishak-died-faces-growing-pressure-to-quit,"The future of the landlord of the mould-infested Rochdale flat that killed Awaab Ishak appears in severe doubt after the two-year-old’s parents were compelled to issue a statement demanding “accountability” after Gareth Swarbrick refused to quit.Swarbrick, the chief executive of Rochdale Boroughwide Housing (RBH), a social landlord, said late on Thursday “I will not be resigning”, despite a call in parliament for him to stand down and the launch of an investigation into potential “systemic failures” at the organisation.But in a clear indication the government was unlikely to accept him continuing in his post, a senior government source described his position as untenable, saying: “It is staggering that Gareth Swarbrick is still in a job.”Awaab’s parents Faisal Abdullah and Aisha Amin released a statement on Friday afternoon warning the landlord has yet to show it grasps “the gravity of the situation”, saying: “Accountability must be done and be seen to be done.”They said the coroner had concluded “that the tragic death of our beautiful Awaab should be a ‘defining moment’ for the housing sector” but said they saw nothing to indicate that was happening.“RBH have an opportunity to demonstrate to society at large, their residents and not least us as a family that they understand the gravity of this situation,” they said. “We await further action from RBH.”The Rochdale MP, Labour’s Tony Lloyd, also dismissed Swarbrick’s attempt to hold on to his post, saying on Friday that Awaab’s death was “preventable and unforgivable” and that the chief executive “clinging to his job is not OK”.On Tuesday, a coroner found exposure to persistent black mould on the walls of the family’s rented home was the cause of the infant’s death in 2020 and that the landlord had failed repeatedly to fix it, blaming the mould on “family lifestyle”.The bathroom had no window, the fan did not work effectively and the window from the kitchen, which had no mechanical ventilation, opened on to a communal hallway. Awaab’s father had been told to “paint over it [the mould]”.Michael Gove, the secretary of state for levelling up, housing and communities, told parliament he believed Awaab’s family, originally from Sudan, “were victims of prejudice”.Chris Clarkson, the Conservative MP for Middleton, which also covers part of Rochdale borough, also revealed that constituents living in another RBH property this week sent him photos of walls “caked in black mould”, which their doctor concluded made two children “severely ill”.The housing ombudsman, an England-wide regulator, has announced an investigation into possible “systemic” failings at the social landlord, which looks after more than 12,000 homes. Rochdale council has called for the housing stock to be returned to local authority control.Swarbrick this week spoke to Gove about Awaab’s case, after which Gove told parliament: “In the course of that conversation, it became even more clear to me that there are systemic problems in the governance and leadership of that organisation.” Gove previously said “it beggars belief” that Swarbrick was still in post.Swarbrick, who earns £157,000 a year, said in a video statement on Thursday he would not quit and said “the conversation around my position has begun to overshadow the most important part of all of this, which is that a family has lost their child”.He apologised in the statement “to Awaab’s family for their loss”, before saying the board of the social landlord had given him “their full backing and trust to continue to oversee the improvements and changes needed within RBH”.In response to the statement, a senior government source told the Guardian on Friday: “‘Rochdale Boroughwide Housing repeatedly ignored a family’s pleas for help, which led to the tragic death of a two-year-old child, Awaab Ishak. It is staggering that Gareth Swarbrick is still in a job. His position is untenable.”Lloyd said: “The law has got to make sure that landlords, both social and private, cannot ignore the health risks of damp and mould. “Awaab’s death was preventable and unforgivable and there needs to be some personal responsibility in this. It is simply evasive to argue that calls for resignation overshadow Awaab’s death and adds to the lack of confidence in RBH and its chief executive.”The case has sparked a national debate about standards in social housing and has echoes of the Grenfell disaster, which was preceded by a social landlord failing to properly listen to tenants’ complaints.The coroner, Joanne Kearsley, said Awaab’s death should be a “defining moment” for the UK’s housing sector. About 450,000 homes in England have problems with condensation and mould.Diane Abbott, the former shadow home secretary, told parliament on Wednesday if the housing chief “had any conscience, he would resign”.Kelly Darlington, the solicitor for Awaab’s family, said: “I think he needs to take responsibility and there needs to be some accountability from Rochdale Boroughwide Housing overall.”Swarbrick had said he backed the government’s commitment to “strengthen the Decent Homes Standard and the importance of the tenant’s voice”, adding: “We have made a fundamental change to our disrepair policy. Equity is at the heart of what we do as a mutual housing society and we will continue to strive for greater inclusion and equality.”In a parallel statement, Alison Tumilty, the chair of the RBH board, said Awaab’s death was “a tragedy of the highest order … we have made mistakes and we are endeavouring to correct them. We have full confidence in Gareth’s leadership. He has the trust of the board. He has extensive knowledge of the sector and the communities of Rochdale.”It is unclear whether Tumilty had also consulted the landlord’s “representative body”, which includes tenants."
Footage of cars hitting pedestrians at zebra crossing ‘horrifies’ MP,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/18/footage-of-cars-hitting-pedestrians-at-bradford-zebra-crossing-horrifies-mp,"An MP has said he is “absolutely horrified” to see footage of drivers ploughing into pedestrians at a zebra crossing where there have been a series of accidents in recent years.The Labour MP Imran Hussain said he was concerned about “accident blackspots” in his Bradford East constituency after clips of the collisions were shared by the television presenter Jeremy Vine.One video showed a pedestrian being thrown into the air by a car that failed to stop, while two others showed motorists driving into cyclists in broad daylight. A fourth clip showed a woman knocked to the ground by a car that crossed at speed at night.The footage has been viewed more than 40,000 times online after being shared by Vine, who described them as examples of “petrosexuals” abusing public spaces. Posting one video, he tweeted: “What the HELL is going on with this zebra???”Bradford council said on Friday it understood local concerns about the crossing on Horton Grange Road, about a mile from the city centre, and would carry out an immediate inspection.A council spokesperson said it was awaiting funding to convert the location to a signalled crossing with traffic lights and that this work would take place “as soon as we can”.It said improvement works were carried out four years ago to replace its Belisha beacons with high-visibility LED units and enhanced white road markings. It is unclear why the crossing appears to have become such an accident hotspot in recent years.Hussain said he had been pressing the council and West Yorkshire police to improve the safety of roads in the city that some drivers use “as rat runs and racetracks”.He added: “I’m absolutely horrified to see this catalogue of incidents where cars have hit pedestrians on what is a well-marked and visible zebra crossing on Horton Grange Road, and it is evidently clear that we need to see much tougher action against those who seemingly have no problem with violating the rules of the road.“For too long, a minority of dangerous drivers in Bradford have been blighting Bradford’s roads and making the lives of the majority of responsible road users an absolute misery, and I’ve been pressing both Bradford council and West Yorkshire police to implement a number of road safety measures at accident blackspots in my constituency, while also pressing ministers to impose tougher sentences for dangerous drivers.”"
"Terror suspect aimed to destroy UK radio masts to ‘topple government’, court hears",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/18/terror-suspect-destroy-radio-masts-topple-government,"A terror suspect plotted to “topple the government” by attacking major communications infrastructure, a court has heard.Oliver Lewin is accused of carrying out reconnaissance of potential targets, purchasing equipment and tools, digging hideouts and seeking to recruit others.Lewin, 38, from Coalville, Leicestershire, previously entered a not-guilty plea to a charge of preparing terrorist acts.The single charge against him relates to a period between 24 July and 25 August last year.He allegedly planned to target transmitter masts and transport infrastructure, such as the M1 in the Midlands, Birmingham crown court heard on Friday.Opening the case against him, prosecutor Annabel Darlow KC said: “By 2021, Oliver Lewin was deeply opposed to the government of the United Kingdom. Mr Lewin, in fact, stated his goal was to topple the British government. He believed that it was dominated by a Jewish elite who took orders from Israel.”“He saw the spread of coronavirus across the world as triggering what he termed the emergence of a Chinese communist system,” she added. “Mr Lewin was also deeply suspicious of the coronavirus vaccination programme, which at that time was in the process of being rolled out across the country.”She said Lewin described himself as being on a “war footing”, adding: “By 2021 he had determined on the use of action to achieve his aim of destabilising the government. His chosen method of attack was to target communication systems and transport infrastructure.”She said he planned to physically “attack the hardware” of communication systems and “cause damage to the road network”, and wanted “widespread coordinated attacks” to take place at different points in that network, the court heard.Under the alias “Crouching Hedgehog”, Lewin used the encrypted messaging app Telegram to try to recruit others, pretending he was ex-army, she said. He later joined a Telegram group infiltrated by undercover police officers, where he issued a “call to arms”.Lewin had a background working as an audiovisual engineer, Darlow said, and had previously worked for a small company that installed and maintained radio masts. She suggested this gave him specialist knowledge that could help him “sabotage masts and other infrastructure”.Lewin looked into targeting a number of transmitter masts in the West Midlands – including at Sutton Coldfield transmitting station, Darlow said. He allegedly told undercover officers Sutton Coldfield was an “exceptionally high-value target”, suggesting “firebombing” sheds there, she said.She added: “That is one of the UK’s most important transmission sites and is in fact the main broadcasting site for the Birmingham and West Midlands area, supporting TV and radio broadcasting services for many millions of users.”Police searched Lewin’s address and found a partly completed work entitled “Civilian Resistance Operations Manual”, she said.In the manual, he allegedly stated: “What we can be certain of is that we are seeing the emergence of a Chinese communist system that is ever accelerating with rapidity. We are not a communist country and should fight with everything we have to prevent it.”She claimed Lewin added: “My ideal primary objective would be to topple the government and all within it and install a civilian-led alternative that doesn’t act for themselves and consider anybody below them mere scum.”The trial continues."
"I’ve kissed a Tory and I’m not ashamed, Labour leader reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/nov/18/keir-starmer-i-kissed-a-tory-and-not-ashamed-labour,"Keir Starmer has tried to reveal a little more about himself, confessing that he has broken the “never kiss a Tory rule” and that he is not ashamed.The Labour party leader said he was “not tribal” when it came to personal relationships and politics because he entered the political scene relatively late in life. Speaking to Times Radio, he suggested only people in the political bubble were focused on maintaining division.Asked about other Labour figures who wear “never kissed a Tory” badges, Starmer said: “I’m afraid I’ve broken that rule. I’m not tribal. I’m on very good terms with many Tory MPs. I’m not ashamed about it and I’ve got very good friends who are Tories and they’ve been very, very good friends of mine for a very, very long time, and long may that last.”Over the summer, Lucy Powell, a member of Starmer’s shadow cabinet, faced criticism after she was pictured wearing a T-shirt with the phrase “never kissed a Tory” at Manchester pride.The Tory MP Sara Britcliffe complained that the phrase created a sense of “us versus them”, while James Cleverly, then the education secretary, joked that if Powell had asked nicely then “one [Tory] will say yes eventually”.Starmer described his attempts to keep life “as normal as possible” for his family and said he did his best to spend time with his children.He said: “I don’t want to be the man in 10 years’ time saying ‘I wish I’d spent more time with my children’. I’ve got a rule of a hard stop on a Friday at 6pm. I won’t be doing any work; I’ll be at home.”"
"Photographer, who was Prince Andrew’s ex-girlfriend, wins damages against Daily Mail",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/nov/18/prince-andrews-ex-girlfriend-koo-stark-wins-damages-against-daily-mail,"Prince Andrew’s former girlfriend Koo Stark has received substantial damages from the Daily Mail after the newspaper wrongly referred to her as a “porn star”.Stark, who now works as a photographer, brought the legal action over a November 2019 piece that referred to Andrew as a “Duke of Hazard” with “very shady friends” and included a photo of Stark from the film The Awakening of Emily captioned “The prince and the porn star”.It referred to Andrew having had “an astonishing relationship with a soft porn actress”, referencing her role in the 1976 film.Stark played the title role in the film, which is described by IMDb as a “romance” movie. The film website summarised its plot: “The year is 1928 and Emily, aged 17, returns home from school in Switzerland. At her family estate in the English countryside, it seems everyone is trying to seduce her.”The Daily Mail article falsely characterised Stark’s role in the film as pornographic. Stark’s lawyer, Francis Leonard, said: “The words at issue meant, and would have been understood to mean, that the claimant is a porn actress who has made her living participating in films which are made for distribution in the pornographic market.“The true position is that Ms Stark has never appeared in a pornographic film or posed for pornographic photographs. None of her work could properly be described as pornographic or indeed as ‘very shady’. In particular, the film The Awakening of Emily is a coming-of-age drama and not a pornographic film.”Leonard said the article was also published on MailOnline but was amended just over nine hours later to correct the reference to Stark, before having all references to her removed in 2021.He continued: “The defendant’s publication of the article and the false statements about her caused the claimant very considerable distress and upset.“The defendant has accepted that the article’s reference to Ms Stark was defamatory and without justification … The defendant has agreed to pay the claimant substantial damages.”The case was also brought against the then-editor and deputy editor Geordie Greig and Gerard Greaves.Gemma McNeil-Walsh, acting for the Mail’s parent company, said: “The defendant through me offers its sincere apologies to the claimant for the distress, embarrassment and upset caused to her by the publication of the Daily Mail article. The defendant accepts there was and is no truth in the allegation advanced about the claimant and is happy to set the record straight.”An apology was also published in Friday’s print edition of the Daily Mail.Stark’s brief relationship with Andrew in the early 1980s, before he married Sarah Ferguson, has made her an ongoing topic of tabloid fascination. There has been renewed media interest in her since Andrew was stripped of his royal honours after paying millions of pounds to settle a sexual assault case brought by Virginia Giuffre.Judge Mrs Justice Collins Rice said: “I note the very full apology, the payment of substantial damages and this statement. Ms Stark is entitled to consider herself, and be considered as, fully vindicated.”"
Public buildings in England and Wales likely to get 15%-20% rises next year,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/18/public-buildings-england-and-wales-property-tax-business-rates-revaluation,"Hospitals, colleges and fire stations are likely to face 15%-20% rises in property tax next year while bills will fall at big banks, including the Bank of England, and department stores such as Harrods.The government on Thursday released details of a revaluation of properties across England and Wales for the calculation of business rates, with many public buildings expected to be among the losers and those in big offices, the largest retail properties and historic hotels among the winners.Across 1,590 NHS hospitals in both nations the rateable value used to calculate bills will jump by 17.4% to £893.35m, according to analysts at Altus Group, Britain’s largest ratings advisory firm, indicating a potential extra £68m on bills. The valuation will jump by 35%, according to advisory firm Gerald Eve. That indicates nearly an additional £1.6m on its bill alone according to Altus.Jerry Schurder at Gerald Eve said hospitals, educational establishments and fire stations were likely to face an increase in business rates, as the amount public buildings pay is linked to the current cost of construction, which rose during the pandemic amid materials and labour shortages.He said education establishments were likely to face an almost 15% rise in rates bill and fire stations and health facilities 16%. School bills are covered by central government.They are among the losers alongside those operating large distribution sheds, such as Amazon, whose bill is expected to rise by 75% at one warehouse in Tilbury, Essex, according to Altus. Supermarkets with food delivery businesses, such as Tesco and Sainsbury’s, are also likely to be hit.Convenience stores will see their rateable values increase overall by 12.7% while hairdressing and beauty salons are facing a 6.3% rise, Altus calculates.However, many independent convenience store owners will be protected by measures to protect small businesses, including a special discount for retail and hospitality outlets and for those whose rateable value is less than £15,000, according to Schurder.He said that many high streets and shopping centres would be “big winners” as business rates valuations are based on rents paid and these had dived during the pandemic when many stores were forced to close for several months.Upmarket department stores Harrods and Selfridges will see their tax bills slump by about £8m each from April next year after the revaluation, which is based on rents paid in 2021 at the time of the pandemic when many central London businesses were struggling with pandemic lockdowns.The largest shops, those over 1,850 metres squared in size, are the biggest retail winners, with their rateable values tumbling by 34.7% on average, according to Altus.The John Lewis department store chain, for example, will save £5m in business rates on London’s Oxford Street store alone, although its costs elsewhere are on the rise as a result of increases in the legal minimum wage next year and higher national insurance payments.The drop in market rents in the City, means the Bank of England’s rate bill will fall by 7%, according to Schurder. Banks based in London’s Canary Wharf will also enjoy a cut in their property taxes after the shift to working from home during the pandemic pushed office rents in the area down by an average 1.7%, with some falling far more. The bill at international bank HSBC’s building in Canary Wharf, for example, is calculated to have fallen by almost 7%.New measures announced by Jeremy Hunt on Thursday mean the drop in the bill will apply in full from next year – whereas previously it would have been phased in jumps of 4% to 5%, meaning that some businesses never saw the full benefit of a cut to their bill."
"Manchester risks losing ‘vital organ of culture’, says Elbow's Guy Garvey",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/18/manchester-risks-losing-vital-organ-in-night-day-cafe-says-guy-garvey,"Manchester risks losing a “vital organ of culture” if its famous Night & Day cafe is forced to close because of noise complaints, the Elbow singer Guy Garvey has said.The 30-year-old venue is facing a crucial court hearing this month after it was issued with a noise abatement notice by Manchester city council.Night & Day, which hosted early gigs by bands including Elbow, Arctic Monkeys and Wet Leg, has said it could be forced to close after a complaint by a resident who moved in nearby during the quiet of the Covid lockdown.The case has prompted a debate about the future of music venues in cities that are increasingly densely populated yet market themselves as vibrant and exciting places to live.Garvey, whose band received their first two contracts after performing at the venue, said: “Manchester’s young musicians like everywhere else have faced a terrible time over the last few years. And to take one of these platforms away – these vital organs of culture – because of development …”Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Friday, Garvey said the Oldham street area of Manchester was a desirable place to live only because Night & Day opened in 1991 “when it was dirty and it was dangerous”.He added: “To take it away so that it becomes a nicer place to live says that Oldham street is only for people that can afford to live there.”Just yards from Night & Day, a three-bedroom apartment is on sale for more than £440,000 – double the average property price for north-west England. Several other upmarket flats are advertised on the same street for about £300,000, far outside the grasp of the average Mancunian.Night & Day will appeal against the noise abatement notice at a court hearing beginning in Manchester on 30 November. If it loses, the council would have the power to seize and confiscate equipment or apply for a high court injunction.Manchester city council said: “It must be made explicitly clear from the outset that the council has never threatened to close down this venue, nor is there any legislation which would allow a noise abatement notice to be used to close a premises.”Garvey accused the council of failing to ensure the flats were properly soundproofed – a claim the council rebuts. The council insists all planning regulations were met when it approved the development in early 2000.A council spokesperson said it had received five complaints from four properties regarding noise since July 2021, and the noise abatement notice affected only after-hours DJ sets not live bands before midnight.But the venue has said these music nights are essential for the business because people do not pay much to see live bands.Garvey said: “The last two times this has happened they have come to a compromise with the Night & Day, which has involved them taking measures to soundproof the venue – they put a porch in and various other things.“Long story short: it’s a mess-up on the council’s part which they keep trying to patch.”A council spokesperson said it completed an initial acoustic report for the apartments and there was a recommendation for a second report – but this was the responsibility of the developer as it involved building regulations and not planning regulations.He added: “The council is, and remains, supportive of the music scene in Manchester, which Night & Day has championed, but we have to comply with our duties in respect of statutory nuisance.”"

Flooding shuts schools and disrupts travel after heavy rain in Scotland,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/18/flooding-shuts-schools-and-disrupts-travel-after-heavy-rain-in-scotland,"Schools have closed, roads left impassable and rail journeys heavily disrupted as heavy rain drenched parts of Scotland.Elsewhere in the UK, rivers burst their banks, sometimes trapping drivers, after the torrential downpours on Thursday.A Met Office amber weather warning, the second-highest, was in place until 9pm covering an area that included Aberdeen, Stonehaven, Montrose and the eastern Cairngorms.Forecasters warned communities could be cut off, homes and businesses flooded and there was a “danger to life from fast-flowing or deep flood water”. Parts of the Grampians and Cairngorms could expect to have more than 150mm of rain with areas around Inverurie, Brechin and Ballater particularly badly affected.A yellow warning from Kelso in the Borders up the east coast of Scotland to Banff was also in place on Friday. It had been due to expire at 6pm but was extended to midnight because the rainfall was slower to ease than predicted.In Angus, all schools in Brechin, Montrose and Kirriemuir were closed due to localised flooding as well as more than a dozen others.Aberdeenshire council reported 11 power cuts and said some roads were impassable. It advised people to avoid travel if possible.Network Rail Scotland said the line between Aberdeen and Dundee was closed as it dealt with “flooding at multiple sites along the route” while the line between Aberdeen and Inverness was closed at Dyce and at Huntly.The east coast mainline was closed for a time between Dunbar and Reston but later reopened. In Edinburgh, cars were trapped and abandoned at the flooded junction of a busy road.The Scottish Environment Protection Agency on Friday had in place five severe flood warnings, 28 flood warnings and nine flood alerts.The disruption came after a band of rain hit the south-west coast of England on Wednesday evening before travelling north-east over two days, accompanied by cooler temperatures in a change to the previous unseasonably warm weather.In England, which was hit by torrential rain on Thursday, there were nine flood warnings in place and 69 flood alerts. The warnings included the River Ouse at York, which broke its banks on Friday morning. In the village of Alfriston in East Sussex, a refuse lorry and its crew were trapped by a severely flooded road. Newcastle, Sunderland, Gateshead and Doncaster were among places in England facing travel disruptions to rail networks, metro lines, roads and bus services.Stephen Dixon, a spokesperson for the Met Office, said the rain would slowly peter out by Friday evening but temperatures would drop overnight, as low as -4C in Northern Ireland. Saturday was expected to be clear, followed by more rain on Sunday.“That sets up what is really the theme of the next week, which is continued wet and windy weather for much of the UK,” he said."
Chain sold out of administration to SSP with loss of 100 jobs,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/18/amt-coffee-sold-out-of-administration-to-ssp-with-loss-of-100-jobs,"The AMT Coffee chain has been sold out of administration with the rescue of 25 outlets. However, 18 will close, leaving 100 employees facing redundancy.Revenues have plummeted coffee chain – which has sites in airports, rail hubs, hospitals and other locations throughout the UK and Ireland – as the pandemic cut footfall.Administrators were appointed on Friday morning, and hours later the business and its assets were sold to SSP Group, a British food service company. SSP will keep 25 AMT Coffee sites that will continue to use the brand name, and retain 200 employees across those locations.AMT Coffee’s most recently filed accounts show sales between January 2020 and the same month the following year were down £7.6m compared with the prior period, a fall of 63%. Overall the company made an annual loss of £3.2m in 2020, against a loss of £1.2m in the previous year.A strategic report attached to accounts said Covid-19 “dramatically affected” the business. It pointed to a number of other risks and uncertainties the firm faced, such as a “shortage of labour” in the UK, supply chain disruption due to Covid and Brexit, and other economic factors, such as inflation.Sam Birchall, a director at the firm’s administrator, Interpath Advisory, said: “AMT Coffee is a familiar name to many commuters and travellers across the UK and Ireland, so we are pleased to have concluded this transaction with such a well-established operator in SSP Group, safeguarding the future of the brand as well as a significant number of jobs.“Regrettably, a total of 18 sites which have not transferred to the purchaser will close with immediate effect, with approximately 100 employees across those sites and the company’s head office being made redundant.”Nick Holloway, joint administrator at Interpath, added: “The pandemic and broader economic headwinds have made this a particularly tough period for those working across the UK hospitality industry. Our priority as joint administrators will be to provide support and assistance to those impacted by redundancy.”The Covid crisis caused a severe sales slump for coffee chains and independent cafes. Spending on takeaway hot drinks in the UK plummeted by 90% in April 2020 during the first lockdown."
Offices closed after Elon Musk’s loyalty oath sparks wave of resignations,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/17/elon-musk-twitter-closes-offices-loyalty-oath-resignations,"The crisis at Twitter reached new heights after hundreds of employees were reported to have rejected Elon Musk’s ultimatum to keep working for the business, threatening its ability to keep operating.As the company temporarily closed its offices to staff on Friday, Twitter users began saying their goodbyes and linking to accounts on other platforms.#RIPTwitter, #TwitterDown, Mastodon and Myspace were all trending on the platform after the deadline passed on Musk’s ultimatum for the remaining workforce to sign up for “long hours at high intensity” by Thursday, or leave. It has been estimated that hundreds of the remaining staff, already cut from 7,500 to around 3,750 in the wake of Musk’s takeover of Twitter last month, opted to go.The departures include many engineers responsible for fixing bugs and preventing service outages, raising questions about the stability of the platform amid the loss of employees and prompting hurried debates among managers over who should be asked to return, current and former employees said.In an early sign that the number of those declining to sign was greater than anticipated, Musk eased off a return-to-office mandate he had issued a week ago, telling employees on Thursday they would be allowed to work remotely if their managers asserted they were making “an excellent contribution”.Twitter later announced via email that it would close “our office buildings” and disable employee badge access until Monday, the New York Times reported.Online, users were speculating that the site could go down in a matter of hours or days. In July Twitter’s former head of security, Peiter Zatko, filed a whistleblower complaint warning of poor infrastructure standards at Twitter even before Musk’s takeover, alleging that more than 50% of Twitters 500,000 data centre servers are running software that is out of date or have other known security problems.On Thursday evening, the version of the Twitter app used by employees began slowing down, according to one source familiar with the matter, who estimated that the public version of Twitter was at risk of breaking during the night. Website DownDetector reported a significant uptick in user reports of issues on the site.“If it does break, there is no one left to fix things in many areas,” the person said, who declined to be named for fear of retribution.One information security expert warned that the site could now be vulnerable to hacks if overnight departures have depleted some engineering functions severely.“Twitter, like any big website, is the target of lots of unsophisticated attackers and a few sophisticated ones,” said Steven Murdoch, a professor of security engineering at University College London. “Many security measures are preventative but some rely on skilled personnel monitoring for unusual behaviour, investigating these cases, and taking the appropriate steps to keep the attackers away from critical systems. Are these people still in their jobs?”A US-based Twitter engineer who resigned on Thursday said he would have been “on-call constantly” had he stayed, dealing with complex systems he had no experience in because of the scale of cuts among engineering colleagues. Peter Clowes, a senior software engineer at Twitter, tweeted: “If I stayed I would have been on-call constantly with little support for an indeterminate amount of time on several additional complex systems I had no experience in.” The news prompted an outpouring of concern among users on the platform, and prompted many users to link to their accounts on Instagram or Mastodon as an alternative.US representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted she could be found on Instagram or on email.She followed up with a tweet saying those employees who built the company deserved better. “Shout out to all the workers at Twitter. You all built a vital place for connection and deserved so much better,” she said.Official government accounts also began providing means of being found elsewhere.On Friday Ireland’s taoiseach, Micheál Martin, described Twitter’s behaviour as “unacceptable” and said that “employees of any company must be treated with respect and dignity.” Prior to Musk’s takeover, Twitter employed 500 people in Ireland.Musk was tweeting through the drama. On Friday he posted memes mocking the expected demise of the platform and said Twitter usage was at an “all-time high” – something he blamed on media reporting about Twitter.Earlier, Musk was meeting some top employees to try to convince them to stay, said one current employee and a recently departed employee who was in touch with Twitter colleagues.In a private chat on Signal with about 50 Twitter staffers, almost 40 said they had decided to leave, according to the former employee.And in a private Slack group for Twitter’s current and former employees, about 360 people joined a new channel titled “voluntary-layoff”, said a person with knowledge of the Slack group.A separate poll on Blind asked staffers to estimate what percentage of people would leave Twitter based on their perception. More than half of respondents estimated at least 50% of employees would leave. Fortune Magazine reported that 75% of Twitter’s remaining 3,700 employees might have left on Thursday.While it is unclear how many employees have chosen to stay, the numbers highlight the reluctance of some staffers to remain at a company where Musk has hastened to fire half its employees including top management, and is ruthlessly changing the culture to emphasise long hours and an intense pace.Twitter, which has lost many of its communication team members, did not respond to a request for comment.Blue hearts and salute emojis flooded the site and its internal chatrooms on Thursday, the second time in two weeks as Twitter employees said their goodbyes.By 6pm EST, more than two dozen Twitter employees across the United States and Europe had announced their departures in public Twitter posts reviewed by Reuters, though each resignation could not be independently verified.Early on Wednesday, Musk had emailed Twitter employees, saying: “Going forward, to build a breakthrough Twitter 2.0 and succeed in an increasingly competitive world, we will need to be extremely hardcore.”The email asked staff to click “yes” if they wanted to stick around. Those who did not respond by 5pm eastern time on Thursday would be considered to have quit and given a severance package, the email said.As the deadline approached, employees scrambled to figure out what to do.One team within Twitter decided to take the leap together and leave the company, one employee who is leaving told Reuters.In an apparent jab at Musk’s call for employees to be “hardcore”, the Twitter profile bios of several departing engineers on Thursday described themselves as “softcore engineers” or “ex-hardcore engineers”.Reuters contributed to this report."
US attorney general to reportedly appoint special counsel in Trump criminal investigation,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2022/nov/18/jan-6-trump-republicans-house-democrats-us-politics-latest,"The plan for a special counsel appears to be linked to allegations of the unlawful retention of national defense information at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort and residence in Florida, according to the Reuters news agency, which cites an unnamed senior Department of Justice official.The agency says a senior DoJ official has named a special prosecutor to investigate the entirety of the department’s criminal investigation into that potential offense.Meanwhile, CNN reports that the special counsel will also review the parallel DoJ investigation into Trump’s involvement around the insurrection on January 6, 2021, when extremist supporters of the-then president invaded the US Capitol in an attempt to prevent the certification of Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election by congress.We will bring you more developments as they happen.Attorney general Merrick Garland plans to hold a press conference at 2:15 pm eastern time, following reports that he will name a special prosecutor to decide whether to bring charges against Donald Trump and his allies.Beyond just the investigation into government secrets Trump allegedly retained at his Mar-a-Lago resort, Politico reports that the special counsel will also look into Trump’s attempts to undermine the 2020 election. The justice department has not yet announced who they will be appointed to job.This blog will cover Garland’s address as it happens.The plan for a special counsel appears to be linked to allegations of the unlawful retention of national defense information at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort and residence in Florida, according to the Reuters news agency, which cites an unnamed senior Department of Justice official.The agency says a senior DoJ official has named a special prosecutor to investigate the entirety of the department’s criminal investigation into that potential offense.Meanwhile, CNN reports that the special counsel will also review the parallel DoJ investigation into Trump’s involvement around the insurrection on January 6, 2021, when extremist supporters of the-then president invaded the US Capitol in an attempt to prevent the certification of Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election by congress.We will bring you more developments as they happen.US attorney general Merrick Garland plans to name a special counsel to examine whether former president Donald Trump should be prosecuted as a result of investigations carried out by the Department if Justice (DoJ), the Wall Street Journal reports, citing an unnamed source “familiar with the matter”.The Journal reports:“A formal announcement, which is expected by Friday afternoon, would come three days after Mr. Trump announced another bid for the presidency and would mark the naming of the third independent prosecutor in five years to examine issues involving Mr. Trump. The exact scope of the special counsel’s remit and who it would be couldn’t be determined.”More details to come…A judge refused today to quash a subpoena issued to former White House press secretary Jen Psaki that seeks her deposition in a lawsuit filed by Missouri and Louisiana, alleging that the Biden administration conspired to silence conservative voices on social media, the Associated Press reports.Psaki filed a motion in federal court in Alexandria seeking to quash the subpoena, saying that she had no relevant information to provide and that a deposition would place an undue burden on her. The Justice Department supported her efforts to quash.US magistrate Ivan Davis said during a hearing today that he was unimpressed with Psaki’s arguments. But he did not reject her request outright. Instead, he transferred the case back to Louisiana, where the lawsuit was filed.Psaki was allowed to file a separate opposition in Virginia because she lives in the state and would be deposed there.Davis, though, said it makes no sense for him to wade into the questions of whether Psaki’s testimony is relevant when the judge in Louisiana is more familiar with the case.He also said Psaki failed to show how sitting for a deposition in her home state would be an undue burden. In fact, he said that if Psaki has little information to contribute, as she alleges, it shouldn’t be much of a burden at all.Justice Department lawyer Indraneel Sur indicated he would appeal Davis’ ruling to a district judge in Alexandria and asked the judge to stay his ruling to provide time to do so, but Davis declined.The lawsuit filed by the attorney general in Missouri and Alexandria accuses Joe Biden, former federal health official Anthony Fauci and others of conspiring with social media companies to restrict free speech by censoring conservative opinions about the Covid-19 response and other issues.Readers will have noticed that politicians, and indeed journalists and people, are still tweeting. But for how much longer?Here’s the Guardian’s Kari Paul:Amid ongoing fallout from Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter, speculation of the platform’s imminent collapse is swirling – leaving users wondering what parts of their online selves they’ll get to keep.After Musk laid off thousands of workers, many users have reported signs the platform is falling apart in real time – from glitching home pages to log-in failures – and researchers are desperately urging users to download their tweets in case Twitter implodes completely.“If there’s something you care about on Twitter, now’s the time to become like a temporary expert in digital archiving measures,” said Caroline Sinders, an artificial intelligence researcher and founder of human rights lab Convocation Research and Design.Digital archiving – the process of preserving online content for future use – has expanded steadily since the launch of the internet, but still exists in a patchwork, decentralized framework.There’s more to read, here. But the last bit is killer:If you want to save tweets – whether jokes from a favorite celebrity or the last thoughts of a loved one who has passed – an expert suggests a relatively analog solution.“Print out their tweets, and put them in a box,” the expert said. “They will last longer in every way.”He may still be the most popular man in the Republican party, but Donald Trump’s announcement of a new run for the White House this week has been fodder for his opponents, most recently his former top diplomat Mike Pompeo. Meanwhile, conservatives have continued their quest to stop Kevin McCarthy from becoming speaker in the Republican-run House next year, while Democrats’ transition away from Nancy Pelosi’s leadership appears to be running much more smoothly.Here’s what else has happened today so far:Donald Trump’s former top diplomat Mike Pompeo has again attacked his one-time boss:Pompeo’s wording echoes Trump’s promise on the campaign trail 2016 that if he was elected, supporters would “get tired of winning.” Pompeo, who served as secretary of state from 2018 till the end of Trump’s term in 2021, is thought to be considering a run for the presidency in 2024.Perhaps he’ll elaborate on his thoughts about the former president in his speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition later today:The Biden administration has petitioned the supreme court to allow its plan to relieve some student debt relief to proceed, Bloomberg News reports:Biden in August announced the plan to forgive as much as $20,000 in federal student debt for people earning less than $125,000 a year, or households earning below $250,000.Conservative activists and states immediately sued to stop the program, and last month, an effort by six Republican-led states succeeded in getting it temporarily halted.Why didn’t last week’s midterm elections produce a landslide victory for Republicans? Why did so many people vote for Democrats, despite Joe Biden’s approval rating being underwater for more than a year?Definitive answers to these questions are elusive, no matter how important they may be. The Guardian surveyed readers for their views on last Tuesday’s polls, and you can read what they had to say below: New York Democrat Hakeem Jeffries formally announced his bid for House Democratic leader in a letter to colleagues released today.“When I initially sought the position of Chair of the House Democratic Caucus two terms ago, none of us could have predicted the challenges the American people would confront in the years to come. However, time and again, throughout a period of enormous turmoil for our nation, House Democrats rose to the occasion,” Jeffries said.“Today, I write to humbly ask for your support for the position of House Democratic Leader as we once again prepare to meet the moment.”Jeffries’s candidacy comes after House speaker Nancy Pelosi yesterday announced she would not seek a position in Democratic leadership next year, but would remain as a lawmaker. House majority leader Steny Hoyer also said yesterday he would step down from leadership, paving the way for a new generation of Democrats to lead the party in Congress's lower chamber. Jeffries is expected to be joined by Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, who is seeking the position of whip, which is the Democrats’ number-two position in the House and responsible for rallying lawmakers for or against legislation. Pete Aguilar of California is set to run for the third-ranking position of caucus chair.In a statement released today, Pelosi signaled her support for the trio. “In the 118th Congress, House Democrats will be led by a trio that reflects our beautiful diversity of our nation. Chair Jeffries, Assistant Speaker Clark and Vice Chair Aguilar know that, in our Caucus, diversity is our strength and unity is our power,” Pelosi wrote. “A new day is dawning – and I am confident that these new leaders will capably lead our Caucus and the Congress.”The House GOP may be gearing up to investigate the Biden administration, but first it needs to decide who the chamber’s speaker will be.Caucus leader Kevin McCarthy is considered a frontrunner, but faced opposition this week during the vote to determine the party’s nominee for the position. While McCarthy prevailed, the episode, coupled with the GOP’s expected razor-thin majority in the chamber, raised the possibility of a contentious speakership election when the new Congress begins on 3 January. Today, rightwing congressman Andy Biggs reiterated his opposition to McCarthy’s candidacy. Biggs mounted an unsuccessful challenge to McCarthy in the election held Tuesday for House speaker nominee.Joining in the sentiment was fellow conservative congressman Matt Gaetz:However, Paul Ryan, the last Republican to serve as House speaker, thinks McCarthy will put it off. “I know all the people. I know the players. I think he’s going to be fine,” Ryan told Politico on Thursday.While the effort may not end in impeachment, the incoming Republican House majority is already pushing for testimony from top homeland security officials, including secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.GOP lawmakers on the judiciary committee sent the department a letter today requesting documents and testimony from a range of officials:Should these hearings occur next year, expect the committee’s new Republican leadership to spend much of their time exploring the situation at the southern border, where migrant arrivals have lately hit records. The GOP has sought to blame the Biden administration for the influx, and will likely use an appearance by Mayorkas and top officials in US Customs and Border Protection to make their case.Republicans may have retaken the majority in the House, but their narrow margin of control is already affecting their priorities.One of the consequences is that it’s made it less likely the party will launch impeachment proceedings against Joe Biden or one of his cabinet secretaries, such as homeland security chief Alejandro Mayorkas, or attorney general Merrick Garland, Politico reports.The piece has a number of Republicans who hold moderate views or represent swing districts cautioning against attempts to force the Democratic leaders out of office, which would have virtually no chance of succeeding since Biden’s allies still control the Senate.“I want to warn our colleagues: There may be some activists in our party that want impeachment. But I can tell you that the swing voters and the independent voters don’t. …We change leadership by elections, impeachment is the outlier,” Don Bacon of Nebraska says, expressing a sentiment common among GOP lawmakers quoted in the piece.Even Marjorie Taylor Greene, one of the most far-right Republicans in Congress, wasn’t quick to endorse impeachment proceedings when approached by Politico. “I think that what we’re going to do is be proving everything through investigations and evidence. … So we’ve got to do the work on the committee, but I think there will be plenty of evidence to show that,” Greene said.While Republicans managed to claw back control of Congress’s lower house last week, The Guardian’s Sam Levine reports Democrats made gains in state legislatures nationwide, with potentially significant consequences for voting and abortion rights:While Democrats staved off a red wave in Washington during the midterm elections, the party’s most significant victories came far away from the US capitol. They were in state legislatures across the country with consequences that will be felt for years to come.Over the last decade, Republicans have quietly amassed power in state capitols, investing in races for state legislatures that can be decided by just a few hundred votes. It’s an investment that has paid off wildly. Since state legislatures draw electoral districts in many places, Republicans have used that advantage to entrench their power, drawing district lines that further guaranteed their majorities. They’ve also used those majorities to pass measures that make it harder to vote, strip LGBTQ+ protections, loosen gun laws and restrict access to abortion.Further complicating attempts to hold Donald Trump accountable is his return to the campaign trail. Chris McGreal looks at just how much of a factor his decision might play:The law is clear. The politics less so.If Donald Trump’s third run for the White House is propelled by large doses of narcissism and revenge, the former US president must also be hoping that a high-profile political campaign may help keep his myriad legal problems at bay before they bury him.Prosecutors from New York to Georgia and Washington DC have spent months digging into an array of alleged crimes before, during and after Trump was president. Some of those investigations are coming to fruition with indictments expected to follow within months, possibly weeks, on charges that potentially could see Trump become the first former US president to go to prison.His declaration that he is once again a candidate changes nothing under the law. Legal minds broadly agree that while a sitting president is protected from prosecution in office, that immunity disappears when they leave the White House.But then there is the politics of a prosecution against a presidential candidate who has already dismissed the investigations of his attempts to overturn the 2020 election, the hoarding of top secret documents, and allegedly fraudulent business practices, as “politically motivated” and a Democratic “witch-hunt”.Here’s more from The Guardian’s Hugo Lowell on the issue of the January 6 committee’s criminal referrals, which might be its most consequential piece of unfinished business:The House January 6 select committee has created a subcommittee to examine the scope of potential criminal referrals it might make to the justice department over the Capitol attack as well as what materials to share with federal prosecutors, its chairman and other members said on Thursday.The special subcommittee – led by Congressman Jamie Raskin, overseeing a four-person group that also involves Liz Cheney, Adam Schiff and Zoe Lofgren – has been chiefly focused on whether they have uncovered sufficient evidence that former US president Donald Trump violated civil and criminal statutes.The subcommittee has also been tasked with resolving several other outstanding issues, the panel’s chairman Bennie Thompson said. They include what materials to share with the justice department before the end of December, and its response to Trump and Republican lawmakers who have not complied with subpoenas.A reminder of some of the unfinished business awaiting the January 6 committee as the end of the year – and the end of its mandate – approach:First, there’s the matter of Donald Trump. At what was likely its final public hearing last month, the lawmakers publicly voted to subpoena the former president’s testimony and documents. While Trump reportedly was open to the idea of appearing publicly before a panel he has no love for, he ultimately decided to challenge the subpoena in court. According to Politico, the panel could as soon as today file its response to his legal challenge.As is typical for congressional select committees, the panel is expected to release a report detailing how the insurrection happened. It will probably be the most anticipated such document since the 9/11 Commission Report released in 2004.The committee also has to decide whether to make criminal referrals to the justice department. Several members have hinted that Trump’s actions during the insurrection amounted to criminal acts, and referring him to the justice department would be a consequential step. They could also refer some of his former officials to face charges, while Politico reports that the members are also looking into whether Trump and his allies tampered with witnesses.Good morning, US politics blog readers. It’s official: Republicans will take control of the House of Representatives when the new Congress starts on 3 January, which means the January 6 committee has only a few weeks left to finish up its investigation into the attack on the Capitol. The bipartisan panel is still interviewing witnesses with knowledge of Donald Trump’s actions and is expected to release a report before the year is finished. Meanwhile, Politico reports that they may as soon as today respond to the former president’s attempt to quash their subpoena compelling his testimony.Here’s what else we can expect today:This post has been corrected to indicate Biden will speak at 1:30 pm, not 1 pm."
Protesters chant anti-regime slogans at boy’s funeral,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/18/iranian-protesters-chant-anti-regime-slogans-at-boys-funeral,"Protesters at the funeral of a young boy whose family say was killed by Iranian security forces have chanted anti-regime slogans and ridiculed the official account of his death.Hundreds of mourners flocked to the city of Izeh in south-western Iran for the funeral of Kian Pirfalak, according to footage posted online.His mother said at the funeral ceremony that Kian was shot on Wednesday by security forces, although Iranian officials insisted he was killed in a “terrorist” attack carried out by an extremist group.“Hear it from me myself on how the shooting happened, so they can’t say it was by terrorists because they’re lying,” his mother told mourners, according to a video posted by the 1500tasvir activist Twitter account. “Maybe they thought we wanted to shoot or something and they peppered the car with bullets … Plainclothes forces shot my child. That is it.”Ridiculing the official version of events, the protesters chanted: “Basij, Sepah – you are our Isis!” according to a video posted by the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR). The Basij is a pro-government paramilitary force and Sepah is another name for Iran’s feared Revolutionary Guard. Isis is an alternative name for the extremist Islamic State group.“Death to Khamenei,” they shouted in another video posted by 1500tasvir, referring to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.Activists have put Kian’s age when he died at nine or 10.Opposition media based outside Iran said another child, 14-year-old Sepehr Maghsoudi, was shot dead in similar circumstances in Izeh on Wednesday.Funerals have repeatedly become flashpoints for protests in the movement that started after the death on 16 September of Mahsa Amini, who had been arrested by the Tehran morality police.Iranian state television reported seven people had been buried, including a nine-year-old boy, saying they had been killed by “terrorists” on motorbikes.The Fars news agency, which is affiliated with the Guard, quoted the governor of Khuzestan province, Sadegh Khalilian, as saying that “foreign elements” were responsible.“Kian Pirfalak, nine, and Sepehr Maghsoudi, 14, are among at least 56 kids killed by Iranian forces working to crush Iran’s 2022 Revolution,” said Hadi Ghaemi, the director of the New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran.IHR also said anti-regime slogans were chanted at the funeral in the northern city of Tabriz for Aylar Haghi, a young medical student who activists say was killed in a fall from a building blamed on the security forces.In a separate development, video clips showing showing the ancestral home of the late founder of the Islamic republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, on fire have been shared widely on social media, with activists saying it was torched by protesters.Reuters verified the location of two video clips using the distinctive arches and buildings that match file images. The semi-official Tasnim news agency, however, denied Khomeini’s house was set on fire, saying a small number of people had gathered outside the house.Social media videos show dozens of people cheering as a flash of fire is sparked in a building. Reuters could not independently verify the dates when the videos were filmed. 1500Tasvir said the incident occurred on Thursday evening in Khomeini’s birth town of Khomein, south of the capital, Tehran. The house had been converted into a museum.“The report is a lie,” said the Tasnim news agency, adding: “The doors of the house of the late founder of the great revolution are open to the public.”"
Moscow hopeful of Brittney Griner-Viktor Bout prisoner swap,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/18/russia-viktor-bout-brittney-griner-us-prisoner-swap,"Russia has said that it hopes to complete a prisoner swap with the United States to return the convicted Russian arms trafficker Viktor Bout in an exchange that would probably include the US basketball star Brittney Griner.Amid the deadliest war in Europe since 1945, Russia and the United States are exploring a deal that could see imprisoned Americans including Griner return to the United States in exchange for Bout.“I want to hope that the prospect not only remains but is being strengthened, and that the moment will come when we will get a concrete agreement,” the Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, was quoted as saying by Interfax.“The Americans are showing some external activity, we are working professionally through a special channel designed for this,” Ryabkov said. “Viktor Bout is among those who are being discussed, and we certainly count on a positive result.“For the two former cold war foes, now grappling with the gravest confrontation since the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, the exchange would mark one of the more extraordinary prisoner swaps in their history.The distinctly upbeat remarks from Ryabkov, the foreign ministry’s point man for the Americas and arms control, contrast with previous statements from Moscow which have cautioned Washington against trying to engage in megaphone diplomacy over the prisoner swap.The possible swap includes Griner, facing nine years behind bars in Russia after being convicted on drug charges, and Paul Whelan who is serving a 16-year sentence in Russia after being convicted of espionage charges that he denies.Known as “the merchant of death”, Bout was one of the world’s most wanted men before his 2008 arrest on multiple charges related to arms trafficking.For almost two decades, Bout was one of the world’s most notorious arms dealers, selling weaponry to rogue states, rebel groups and murderous warlords in Africa, Asia and South America.But in 2008, Bout was snared in an elaborate US sting.Bout was caught on camera agreeing to sell undercover US agents posing as representatives of Colombia’s leftist Farc guerrillas 100 surface-to-air missiles, which they would use to kill US troops. Shortly afterwards, he was arrested by Thai police.Bout was tried on the charges related to the Farc, which he denied, and in 2012 was convicted and sentenced by a court in Manhattan to 25 years in prison, the minimum sentence possible.Ever since, the Russian state has been keen to get him back.Griner has been transferred to a penal colony in the Mordovia region, south-east of Moscow, her lawyers said on Thursday, confirming a Reuters report.At her trial, Griner – who played basketball for a Russian team in the US off-season – said she had used cannabis for relief from sports injuries but had not meant to break the law. She told the court she made an honest mistake by packing the cartridges in her luggage."
Judge blocks key parts of Florida’s ‘Stop-Woke’ law,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/18/judge-florida-ron-desantis-stop-woke-law,"A federal judge in Florida halted part of a state law that limits what colleges and universities can teach students about racism and sexism, calling it “positively dystopian”.Issuing a temporary injunction on the law on Thursday, US district court judge Mark Walker said it violates first amendment rights to free speech, and 14th amendment rights to due process on campuses.Signed into law in April, the legislation – called the Individual Freedom Act and the Stop-Woke (Wrongs to Our Kids and Employees) Act – prohibits educational institutions and businesses from teaching students and employees anything that would cause anyone to “feel guilt, anguish or any form of psychological distress” due to their race, color, sex or national origin.It specifically outlaws teachings that may promote guilt or invoke senses of privilege for “actions committed in the past by other members” of a group.“No one should be instructed to feel as if they are not equal or shamed because of their race,” Ron DeSantis, Florida’s governor, said in April, after signing the bill. “In Florida, we will not let the far-left woke agenda take over our schools and workplaces. There is no place for indoctrination or discrimination in Florida.”The judge responded scathingly in his injunction, making a reference to George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four: “‘It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking 13,’ and the powers in charge of Florida’s public university system have declared the state has unfettered authority to muzzle its professors in the name of ‘freedom,’” he wrote.“Defendants argue that, under this act, professors enjoy ‘academic freedom’ so long as they express only those viewpoints of which the State approves. This is positively dystopian.”DeSantis has maintained a reputation as a crusader against progressive politics. Earlier this month he was re-elected for a second term and is reportedly considering a presidential run in 2024 against Donald Trump, who helped DeSantis build his national profile.The judge’s ruling stops the law’s implementation in colleges and universities in the state. Walker in August blocked the law from affecting businesses, and other challenges are in progress regarding the law’s impact on K-12 education.Walker, who was appointed by Barack Obama, also issued a ruling in January against a conflict-of-interest policy that barred University of Florida faculty from participating in lawsuits against the state, including testifying against state law.“Our professors are critical to a healthy democracy, and the state of Florida’s decision to choose which viewpoints are worthy of illumination and which must remain in the shadows has implications for us all,” Walker wrote on Thursday.“If our ‘priests of democracy’ are not allowed to shed light on challenging ideas, then democracy will die in darkness.”The DeSantis administration said it plans to appeal the ruling. A spokesperson told the Washington Post that the law “protects the open exchange of ideas by prohibiting teachers or employers who hold agency over others from forcing discriminatory concepts on students as part of classroom instruction or on employees as a condition of maintaining employment”.“An ‘open-minded and critical’ environment necessitates that one is free from discrimination,” the spokesperson said."
Two men charged with shooting animals at safari park,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/18/canada-safari-park-shooting-animals-two-charged,"Two Canadian men have been charged with entering a safari park in Quebec and shooting three wild boar and an elk, brazen killings that have left staff at the family-themed park in shock.Police say Mathieu Godard and Jeremiah Mathias-Polson broke through a barrier at Parc Omega on the evening of 10 November.A security guard on duty at the time noticed a vehicle had illegally entered the park and alerted police. Moments later he heard gunshots.“The police quickly arrived and located and intercepted a vehicle. Both men were arrested. Police found four animal carcasses inside the vehicle,” Quebec provincial police spokesperson Marc Tessier told the Canadian Press. Police also seized firearms from the vehicle.The pair face charges including wilfully killing animals kept for a lawful purpose, breaking and entering, illegally transporting firearms and unlawfully firing a firearm during a break and enter.The park, 80 kilometres (50 miles) north-west of Ottawa, is popular with families for its wide range of Canadian animals, including wolves, moose, elk, bison and caribou, that roam the fields and forests of the park. Visitors can drive a 12km route through the facility and feed many of the animals from their vehicles.“We have put all the necessary efforts in place to ensure that this situation does not happen again, for everyone’s safety and for the safety of our precious animals,” an Omega park spokesperson, Billie-Prisca Giroux, said in a statement.Godard, 47, works as a hunting guide and posted images on Facebook of a recent hunting trip in northern Ontario in the days before the incident.Godard was released on bail on Monday and is barred from visiting the park. He is also prohibited from communicating with Mathias-Polson and from carrying a gun. He is also not allowed to consume drugs or alcohol. He did not respond to a request for comment.Police say Mathias-Polson, 21, was on probation when he was arrested on November 10 and remains in custody in Hull, Quebec.The two men are due to appear in a Gatineau courthouse on Friday."
Rome police hunt for possible serial killer after three women found dead,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/18/rome-police-on-the-hunt-for-possible-serial-killer-after-three-women-dead,"Police in Rome are hunting for a possible serial killer after the bodies of three women were found in two apartments in the upmarket district of Prati.Two of the women, both sex workers of Chinese nationality believed to be aged between 40 and 50, were found stabbed to death in an apartment on Via Augusto Riboty.The porter of the building raised the alarm after finding the body of one of the deceased women on the doorstep of the apartment on Thursday morning, while the other body was found inside.The body of a Colombian woman, identified as Marta Castano Torres, also a sex worker who had been stabbed to death, was found by her sister in a basement apartment on a nearby street.Stab wounds to the throat, chest and back were found on the bodies of the Chinese women, who are yet to be identified.A source at Rome police said investigators were working on the theory that the women were murdered by the same person. Torres, 65, who the Italian press said was working as a sex worker to support her daughter financially, is believed to have been killed before the two other victims.The killings occurred a few hundred metres from Italy’s supreme court, in an elegant neighbourhood where in recent years there has been a growth in criminal networks running prostitution businesses out of apartments.The killings have prompted calls for prostitution to become a regulated profession in Italy to protect sex workers. Italy permits street prostitution but organised prostitution and brothels are illegal.“These murders are horrific,” said Ermina Gbido from the Committee for the Civil Rights of Prostitutes, a non-profit organisation founded by sex workers in 1982 to fight against sex trafficking and support people in the profession. “For sure, there are criminal networks that manage sex workers in apartments, exploiting them and making them go from apartment to apartment, working long hours. This is a nasty business. But we also need to understand that there are those who want to do this work but cannot do it in a place of safety as the norms do not allow it.”Federico Rocca, a councillor in Rome for Brothers of Italy, the far-right party of the prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, said the business of prostitution in apartments was strongly rooted in “every district of the city”.“Three people lost their lives, brutally killed by a possible client,” he told the Italian media. “We must wait for the outcome of the investigation but there is sadness over their fate, and at the same time anger as, once again, we’ve had to wait for something serious to happen in order to tear down the wall of hypocrisy surrounding the phenomenon of prostitution in apartments.”"
Hakeem Jeffries on course to become first Black party leader in Congress,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/18/hakeem-jeffries-house-minority-leader-black,"Hakeem Jeffries of New York was on course on Friday to be the first Black party leader in Congress, declaring his candidacy for House minority leader after securing key endorsements to succeed Nancy Pelosi, the current speaker who announced her withdrawal from leadership on Thursday.Democrats will cede control of the House in January, after midterm elections in which Republicans performed less well than expected but still took the lower chamber.Jeffries announced his candidacy after Democrats moved swiftly to head off internal battles and let a new, younger generation take the controls.Pelosi, from California, was the first woman to be speaker and filled the role from 2007 to 2011 and since 2019. But she is now 82.Steny Hoyer of Maryland, 83 and the current majority leader, will also step aside. On Thursday, he said: “Now is the time for a new generation of leaders, and I am proud to offer my strong endorsement to Hakeem Jeffries for Democratic leader.”James Clyburn of South Carolina, the House whip, is also 82. He was reported to be seeking to become assistant leader but for the top spot he endorsed Jeffries, 30 years his junior.Clyburn’s endorsements carry notable clout. As the senior Black Democrat in Congress, his approval of Joe Biden’s presidential bid was widely held to have propelled the former vice-president to victory in the presidential primary in 2020.Jeffries was reportedly set to be joined in House Democratic leadership by Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, as minority whip, and Pete Aguilar of California, a member of the January 6 committee who will run for caucus chair.Joe Neguse of Colorado, another rising Black Democrat who was a House manager in the second Trump impeachment, was also seeking a leadership slot but faced being blocked by Clyburn.Pramila Jayapal of Washington state, the leader of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, was reported to be backing off a bid for a leadership role, in the aftermath of an embarrassing strategic error over a letter from progressives to Biden about US aid to Ukraine.Clark, 59 and currently assistant speaker, told the Washington Post: “I have the track record of bringing people and solutions together, and I have built trust across the caucus in different ideological corners, geographic parts of our caucus by listening and really knowing the issues that members care about, where they need to be able to deliver for their districts.”Jeffries is widely held to be an effective communicator, unafraid of confronting opponents. On his official Twitter account, the pinned tweet shows a stern rebuke of the supreme court justice Clarence Thomas, from a House judiciary committee session earlier this year, shortly after leak of the decision overturning the right to abortion.Jeffries said: “Let me ask this question of Brother Thomas. Why are you such a hater?“Hate on civil rights, hate on women’s rights, hate on reproductive rights, hate on voting rights, hate on marital rights, hate on equal protection under the law, hate on liberty and justice for all, hate on free and fair elections? Why are you such a hater and you think you can get away with it? Escape public scrutiny because you think that shamelessness is your superpower?”Jeffries rose to national notice when he was elected a decade ago, in part thanks to being called, by sources including the Washington Post, “Brooklyn’s Barack Obama”.Theodore Wells, Jeffries’ former mentor at the Manhattan law firm Paul Weiss, told the Post, Jeffries was “someone who works easily within both the Black and white communities” and represents “a natural evolution in the background of African American politicians.“The prior generation of African American politicians had their roots in the civil rights movements of the 1960s, but Hakeem’s generation grew up in a more multicultural America, and in that sense their backgrounds and perspectives are different.”On Thursday, one House Democrat, Matt Cartwright of Pennsylvania, told Bloomberg News Jeffries had been “a phenomenal caucus chair. I can’t think of a single misstep that he’s made. So I think he’s up to” being minority leader."
Sentencing to begin after four-month trial,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/18/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-trial-sentencing,"Sentencing is due to get under way for the Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, who faces up to 20 years in prison over her role in the blood testing firm that collapsed after its technology was revealed to be largely fraudulent.Holmes is due to return on Friday morning to the San Jose, California, courthouse where her nearly four-month-long trial took place in 2021. She was convicted in January on four counts of defrauding investors.Experts say Holmes is likely to face substantial time behind bars, with federal sentencing guidelines suggesting additional years for larger dollar amounts of fraud. The charges for which Holmes was convicted included wire fraud totaling more than $140m.Federal prosecutors have suggested the judge sentence Holmes to 15 years in prison and require her to pay $800m in restitution, while the founder’s lawyers have requested a sentence of no more than 18 months to be served on house arrest.Holmes founded Theranos after dropping out of Stanford at 19 years old, promising a revolutionary technology that could run hundreds of health tests on just a drop of blood. The company attracted big-name backers like former secretary of state Henry Kissinger and the former defense secretary James Mattis, who testified against her in the trial.Theranos’s downward spiral began when the Wall Street Journal in 2015 revealed shortcomings and inaccuracies in its core technology. Theranos dissolved in 2018 and Holmes was charged with 12 counts of fraud, alongside her co-executive and former romantic partner Sunny Balwani, who was convicted on 12 counts in his own trial.More than 130 people submitted letters of support for Holmes ahead of the hearing, including her current partner Billy Evans and Senator Cory Booker. “I firmly believe in the possibility of rehabilitation and in the power of redemption for anyone,” Booker wrote of Holmes, whom he said he considers a friend.Throughout the trial, Holmes’s lawyers cast her as an ambitious but misguided young founder who was unaware of the extent to which Theranos’s technology was malfunctioning. In a letter to judges filed last week, they argued sending Holmes to prison was unnecessary.“Ms Holmes is no danger to the public,” Holmes’s lawyers said in the court documents. “She has no criminal history, has a perfect pre-trial services compliance record and is described by the people who know her repeatedly as a gentle and loving person who tries to do the right thing.”Her legal team has also argued Holmes was the victim of abuse at the hands of Balwani, who they say influenced her decisions at the company that led to its collapse. Balwani, who has denied these claims, is due to be sentenced in December."
Ireland hosts climate science circus,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/nov/18/we-want-people-to-laugh-gasp-and-hope-ireland-hosts-climate-science-circus,"Cop27 may have been dismissed as a circus in some quarters, but a group of scientists and performers is staging a real circus in Ireland to inspire people to help tackle the climate crisis.The eclectic mix of engineers, conservation experts, clowns, jugglers and acrobats will perform this weekend in what is billed as Europe’s first circus science and environment festival.Circus Science by the Sea aims to harness entertainment and storytelling for climate awareness and action – and possibly to sprinkle some joy amid gloom over Cop27, the UN conference in Egypt.The festival will take place on Saturday and Sunday in the town of Westport and Achill island in County Mayo, scenic parts of Ireland’s Atlantic coast that face environmental challenges.“We don’t want people to feel powerless and miserable and that’s it all too late,” said Dea Birkett, the festival’s director and a founder of Circus250, an Achill-based community interest company. “We want people to laugh, to gasp and be full of hope. We want the joy of circus to be an engine for change.”The inaugural festival is part of Science Week, an annual event funded by the state agency Science Foundation Ireland. The shows, discussions and workshops are free, as are the puns. “Ireland’s most elevated scientists – science on stilts – taking interactive science to new heights,” says a Mayo county council publicity blurb.The festival would reflect the surrounding landscape, said Birkett. “In Achill we’re on the edge of the world. The world’s plastic ends up on our beaches. Climate change affects rural communities like ours. We notice the seasons, agriculture, the water level.”The festival has gathered shows that routinely tour Ireland and the UK. One features Angelica Santander as a clown named Juanita who appears buried under plastic that she accumulated through everyday use over the past year. Santander mimics swimming and dancing through it before inviting the audience to help repurpose and reimagine the plastic.A fruit-juggling and plate-spinning show weaves in information about an orange’s airmiles. In a show called “nature’s secret circus” an environmental scientist and circus tutors teach children acrobat shapes and movements that reflect the landscape.Another act, StrongWomen Science, features Maria Corcoran, an environmental scientist, and Aoife Raleigh, an engineer. They promote scientific inquiry while juggling liquid, eating fire, balancing chairs on chins and performing acrobatics with hula hoops.Circus tricks and problem-solving logic engage a similar part of the brain, said Raleigh, who learned circus skills while working as an engineer in Belfast. “Experimentation, creativity and embracing failure are the key ideas in both. Even though the result is very different, the methods to get there are often the same.”To learn a new trick one must think analytically, said Raleigh. “I try the movement and, if it doesn’t work, I have to figure out what the problem might be, make adjustments and try it again. This process continues tens or even thousands of times until you perfect the technique.”Circus can visually represent scientific principles, said Corcoran, who joined a juggling society while studying environmental science at university. “Circus is about pushing the boundaries of what is possible with the body and objects. Science is about pushing the boundaries of our knowledge and understanding of how the world works.”In addition to climate awareness, both performers hope to inspire girls to study science, technology, engineering and maths. “We need to inform young girls about the uncredited achievements of female scientists in the past and ensure that women never get left behind again,” said Corcoran.A seal rescue charity and coastal conservation group will launch a recruitment drive during the festival.Instead of feeling guilty or helpless about using plastic or driving cars, people who attend the festival should come away enthused and inspired, said Birkett. “Everybody gets circus. It portrays difficult and challenging issues in the most accessible way. Climate change, plastic pollution, the state of the ocean – they won’t go away, and neither will circus.”"

UK readers: share your tips for celebrating Christmas on a budget,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/nov/18/uk-readers-share-your-tips-for-celebrating-christmas-on-a-budget,
Amateur poster who became $54m-a-year pro,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/18/new-youtube-king-mrbeast-amateur-poster-who-became-54m-a-year-pro,"YouTube’s short 17-year history is one of human civilisation played on fast-forward. The first videos uploaded to the website were shabby, amateur productions from enthusiasts with cameras, made on a shoestring budget. Today, the most popular videos have eye-watering budgets more akin to TV shows.Few people demonstrate YouTube’s shift better than Jimmy Donaldson, better known to his 112 million subscribers as MrBeast. This week Donaldson, 24 and born in Wichita, Kansas, became YouTube’s king, surpassing Felix “PewDiePie” Kjellberg as the most subscribed-to individual on the platform.Donaldson’s YouTube viewers come to him for madcap moments. YouTube is a platform of extremes, but Donaldson pushes the envelope in a different way to the shock-jock style of his peers Jake and Logan Paul, or the dangerous stunts of others desperately seeking fame.If most YouTubers are creating scrappy, independent cinema, MrBeast is producing the 21st-century equivalent of massive-cast, massive-set musicals from Hollywood’s golden age. He even has a 60,000 sq foot studio from which he plans and shoots his YouTube content.Among his biggest hits are a viral video where he recreated the sets from the Netflix series Squid Game at a cost of $3.5m (£2.9m), then invited 456 people to compete in challenges to win $456,000 in prize money. He unabashedly splashes the cash on his videos, offering a $1m prize for a game of hide and seek in another clip. He reportedly spends up to $10,000 on the design of each of his video thumbnails, the small squares designed to lure viewers in.“He’s passionate, analytical and creative with his content, he invests heavily in it, and all for towards the goal of viewer enjoyment,” says Ryan Lamont, head of creative at Born Bred Talent, a talent management and creative agency, who is a longtime manager of digital creators.Like many YouTubers, Donaldson started off posting videos in his bedroom, unbeknown to his parents. He joined YouTube in 2012, and has grown his audience since then, rubbing shoulders with Hollywood celebrities and a dating fellow digital creator, Thea Booysen.But YouTube is just one part of the MrBeast brand. Donaldson, who didn’t respond to an interview request for this story, boasts 16 million followers on Twitter, where his bio reads “I want to make the world a better place before I die,” and 21 million followers on Instagram.In a world where digital creators are now more akin to business tycoons, MrBeast isn’t just top of the subscriber league table. He’s one of the nascent industry’s sharpest business minds. Posters of Steve Jobs and Elon Musk are on the walls of his office. He’s rich: Forbes estimates he earned $54m last year. He also runs a successful fast food franchise, MrBeast Burger, which operates from “ghost kitchens” in existing restaurants.What earns Donaldson those riches and fame, however, separates him from the rest of the starry-eyed group of creators on YouTube. He reinvests much of his earnings into new videos, siphoning off a section of that income to charity.In 2020, he started a philanthropic organisation that has since donated 2 million meals to needy people in North Carolina. He launched a campaign, Team Trees, in 2019, to plant 20m trees in the United States. So far, 24m have been put into the ground.It’s a step-change from the man Donaldson has supplanted as the face of YouTube. PewDiePie has been buffeted by racism, antisemitism and exploitation scandals. Yet MrBeast has his own troubled past, with a history of homophobic comments as a teenager. He has also been subject to complaints about being a hard taskmaster to employees – much like Musk, whose picture hangs in his office.For the YouTube community, MrBeast’s good work outweighs those more negative issues. “It’s great that someone who so deeply cares about the craft and his audience is now an ambassador of sorts for YouTube and the wider creator economy,” says Lamont. “He’s charitable, likable, commendable – all good traits for someone with legions of fans who aspire to emulate him.”"
The notorious penal colony holding US basketball star Brittney Griner,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/18/ik-2-mordovia-harsh-notorious-penal-colony-brittney-griner,"The US basketball star Brittney Griner will endure harsh conditions inside the remote Mordovian penal colony to which she has been sent this week to serve her nine-year prison sentence, human rights experts and former prisoners of the colony have said.“Prisons in Mordovia are notoriously terrible, even by Russian standards. The prisons there are known for the harsh regimes and human rights violations,” said Olga Zeveleva, a sociologist at the University of Helsinki who specialises in Russian prison conditions as part of the Gulag Echoes project. “It is a place any prisoner wants to avoid,” Zeveleva said.One popular saying among Russian female prisoners, underlining the grim reality that Griner is about to face, goes: “If you haven’t done time in Mordovia, you haven’t done time at all.”Griner, 32, was handed a nine-year sentence in August for possessing vape cartridges with a small quantity of cannabis oil, after she was arrested at a Moscow airport in February. It came amid fierce tensions between Moscow and Washington over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Deep in the taiga, IK-2 is part of a sprawling network of penal colonies in the north-west of the Mordovia region, about 300 miles east of Moscow. The prisons were built in the early 1930s as part of the gulag system of the Stalin era and together make up one of the largest penal complexes in Europe“When you arrive, it feels like you are entering a different chiefdom. Everything looks like it has been stuck in time for 50 years,” said Judith Pallot, a professor of the human geography of Russia at the University of Oxford, who visited IK-2 in 2017 as part of her research on Russian prisons.Pallot said Griner would share a dormitory with about 100 other women in a crowded space filled with bunk beds. “Prisoners enjoy no private space at all. You aren’t allowed to hang pictures of your loved ones or keep other personal belongings. It is all very sterile and sad,” she said.When prisoners arrive at IK-2 colony, they are first placed for two weeks in a “quarantine block” to be checked for infectious diseases. At this point, Griner will give up her civilian clothes and exchange them for the prison uniform and headscarf that has to be worn for most of the day.“This is a time of adaption to the new prison life,” said Pallot. “You are being told what the internal rules and duties are. The authorities will also examine whether you will be someone who could be a regime violator.”Pallot feared that Griner might struggle initially with getting a grip on all the formal and informal rules that govern a prison colony. “When I was there, everything was in Russian,” she said. “God knows how Griner will understand it all.”During the time of quarantine, it is determined which otryad, or detachment, a prisoner will join for the duration of their sentence. The otryad is the basic building block of a Russian colony. The word refers both to the physical space and the social unit to which a prisoner belongs.After her integration into her otryad, Griner’s day will start at about 6am with a morning call followed by group exercises. The rest of her day will probably be spent behind a sewing machine, where she will be expected to labour for between 10 and 12 hours sewing clothes, mostly uniforms for the prison service and for the Russian army fighting in Ukraine.Human rights workers have for years documented incidents of torture and sexual abuse in Russian male prisons. While that level of violence is less common in female colonies, experts say bullying by fellow prisoners as well as violence perpetrated by prison guards is frequent.“The Russian prison system isn’t interested in rehabilitation, it is based on retribution and punishment. It is a system underpinned by violence,” Pallot said.Russian female colonies have long practised the doctrine of “prisoner self-organisation” to get jobs done around the detachment blocks and to organise prisoners’ daily lives, Pallot said. A woman recruited by the prison administration is designated as “head monitor” and at night prisoners are left virtually unsupervised.“This system goes against all the rules that we have in prisons in the west. It opens the door for both mental and physical bullying,” Pallot said.Pallot and Zeleneva said it was difficult to predict how fellow prisoners would react to Griner, a tall, black, queer woman. “She will certainly be perceived as an exotic figure,” said Zeleneva.Human rights abuses in Mordovian prisons first received widespread international attention in 2013 after Nadezhda Tolokonnikova from the Pussy Riot collective published an open letter decrying her conditions at IK-14, a prison less than four miles from Griner’s IK-2.Tolokonnikova, who spent two years at IK-14 and went on hunger strike over her prison conditions, described in the letter how she was forced to sew police uniforms for 17 hours a day with other exhausted inmates.She wrote: “A threatening, anxious atmosphere pervades the work zone. Eternally sleep-deprived, overwhelmed by the endless race to fulfil inhumanly large quotas, prisoners are always on the verge of breaking down, screaming at each other, fighting over the smallest things.”Conditions at Mordovia’s IK-2 have recently come under scrutiny after a series of complaints from prisoners and human rights organisations, which led the authorities to dispatch a group of investigators to inspect the jail.“Normal prisons don’t apply there,” Olga Shilayeva, who spent time at IK-2 before being released five years ago, said in a video interview with a Russian outlet in 2018. In the interview, Shilayeva said she was routinely beaten up by Vyacheslav Kimyaev, a senior official at the prison who was later promoted to head of the colony.In 2021, investigators concluded that they did not find any violations inside the prison. But in a sign that the authorities were growing unhappy with the public complaints, Kimyaev was recently replaced by a female head, Yelena Pozdnyakova.“It is yet to be seen whether Pozdnyakova will be any different than her predecessors,” said Zeveleva.Human rights experts said it was no coincidence that the authorities had chosen to send Griner to IK-2. Pallot said: “First of all, the local prison authorities are fiercely loyal to Moscow. The central management will know exactly what will be going on there.”Located away from the capital, the colony will also be hard to reach for outsiders. “It will be much harder for human rights groups and journalists to get there and report on what is going on,” she said.Griner will hope she will not have to spend much of her nine-year sentence behind bars. Since her arrest, the US administration has been pushing to involve her in a prisoner exchange with Russia, potentially swapping her for the convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout.“My hope is, now that the [US midterm] election is over, that Mr Putin will be able to discuss with us and be willing to talk more seriously about prisoner exchange,” Joe Biden said at a recent press conference, stressing his desire to get Griner released.Russia made a positive noise on Friday on a potential swap, but for now Griner will have to adapt to her new life. Human rights experts were split on whether the her high-profile status would protect her in jail.“There is a camp that believes that her high-profile stature will act as a shield,” said Zeveleva. But there were also concerns that amid the anti-America hysteria that has gripped Russia, Griner might face even more severe treatment.“In times of war, the rules might be different … In any case, she won’t have a pleasant time there,” Zeveleva said."
Luxury brands report booming sales,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/18/sales-jumps-and-plunging-champagne-stocks-despite-crisis-luxury-is-booming,"Arwa Alhudhayei and Najla Ahmed are on a spending spree. Walking down New Bond Street – the London home of many of the world’s most expensive luxury brands, including Louis Vuitton, Chanel and Hermès – Arwa lets slip that she spent more than £2,000 the day before.Najla won’t tell the Guardian how much she spent because, she claims, she doesn’t know. “Oh my God,” she says. “It’s such a difficult question, I don’t want to remember how much I spent. It’s hard.”Arwa, who is wearing a grey and white Hermès scarf (£500) she bought yesterday, says the pair, who are visiting from Saudi Arabia, will probably spend about the same today.They have spent a lot of money at Harrods because “we like anything with the Harrods name on it, like specialty tea, chocolate and biscuits”.They also popped into Balenciaga for a £550 T-shirt. A bargain, perhaps, as it turned out to be one of the cheapest items in the store when the Guardian visited to see the brand’s new collaboration with Adidas.Baggy tracksuit bottoms are £850 (and sold out). “Stan Smith Worn-Out Trainers” are £695, and look as if they’re ready for a trip to the dump rather than the catwalk. A bathrobe is £3,450.Arwa and Najla are not alone in spending big despite the global economic crisis, which has left working Britons suffering the biggest slump in living standards since records began in the 1950s.One after another, luxury goods companies have reported bumper sales and profits, as the world’s wealthy enjoy a “roaring 20s” age of decadence similar to the boom in the postwar period a century ago.The company behind Moët & Chandon, Veuve Clicquot, Krug and Dom Pérignon this week said it was “running out of stock on our best champagnes” as it struggles to meet “pent-up demand” for the finest fizz as parties take off following the full easing of coronavirus restrictions.LVMH, the world’s largest luxury goods company, which also owns brands including Christian Dior, Stella McCartney, TAG Heuer watches and Bulgari and Tiffany & Co jewellery, reported a 19% jump in third-quarter sales. Its chief financial officer said that among LVMH’s customers, the economic downturn “has not materialised into full swing yet … if ever it does”.Kering, which owns Gucci, Balenciaga and Bottega Veneta, reported a 14% increase in its latest third-quarter sales, and Hermès, whose Birkin handbags can cost tens of thousands of pounds, reported a 24% jump in sales compared with analysts’ expectations of 15%. The company’s finance director, Eric du Halgouët, said: “For the moment, we don’t see any sign of slowdown in any of our markets.”Soaring sales at Kering and LVMH led to Paris edging ahead of London as Europe’s largest stock market earlier this week as the combined value of the companies listed on the exchange rose.On Thursday, Burberry reported an 11% increase in sales in the three months to the end of September. The luxury British fashion brand, founded 167 years ago by the draper’s apprentice Thomas Burberry and known for its trench coats first used by troops in the first world war, set a target of achieving annual sales of £5bn, up from £2.8bn in the year to April 2022.Jonathan Akeroyd, who joined as chief executive from Versace earlier this year, didn’t set a date for the £5bn target, but said revenue would hit £4bn in three to five years. And, he told investors, “I really believe we can go further than this.”On a chilly autumn morning on Bond St, where Burberry is spending millions redeveloping its flagship store, shoppers do appear to have plenty of money to spend to help Versace and others hit their ever-expanding targets.Striding past the Burberry store building site is Genico Young, a 22-year-old from Indonesia studying business and economics at Leeds University. He is stopped by passersby, who have noticed his handbag.It’s a Hermès Birkin 25 in Ombre Lizard, one of the most expensive handbags in the world and, as Young says, “almost as rare as the Himalyan Birkin”, which sells for £40,000-£50,000.It’s Young’s favourite designer accessory, but far from his only one. “I probably have about 40 to 50 bags,” he says. “I share them with my mum.”Nearby, Kayleigh Hagger, Jody Bines and Emma Riches, from Essex, are on a “girls’ shopping trip” to the West End. First up is Gucci, where Kayleigh is coveting some new shoes (£450). The women, who are in their twenties and early thirties and not in high-paying jobs, say they enjoy shopping at luxury brands despite feeling the squeeze of the cost of living crisis.“You need something to get through,” says Kaleigh, who is carrying a black leather handbag monogrammed with the letters “KH”.“Looking good makes you feel good.” "
"UN silencing Indigenous voices, say banned Cop27 activists ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/18/shameful-un-silencing-indigenous-voices-say-banned-cop27-activists,"Four US activists who had their Cop27 accreditation revoked after briefly interrupting the US president, Joe Biden, in Sharm el-Sheikh have described the UN as “shameful” and say it has silenced Indigenous voices.Big Wind, Jacob Johns, Jamie Wefald, and Angela Zhong missed the second week of the climate conference after being suspended for standing up with a “People vs Fossil Fuels” banner during Biden’s speech last Friday. The Indigenous activists, Wind and Johns, gave a war cry to announce themselves and draw attention to the fossil fuels crisis before security officials confiscated the banner. The group then sat down and Biden continued.The activists appealed against the suspension to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), but the case has not yet been resolved.“We’ve been locked out, our voices silenced,” said Johns, 39, a Washington state-based community organiser from the Akimel O’otham and Hopi tribe. “The climate collapse is coming, we are literally fighting for our lives. If we’re not allowed to advocate for our future, who will? It’s shameful.”Wind, 29, an Indigenous conservation associate for Wyoming Outdoor Council and member of the Northern Arapaho tribe, said: “This is a clear example of radical Indigenous people and youth being silenced, we’re muted when we try to express our frustration in these spaces. It shows the UN’s true colours.”Cop27 has been one of the most repressive – and expensive – UN climate summits on record. The Egyptian regime banned any unsanctioned protests or actions taking place inside or outside the conference centre. A handful of summit delegates have been arrested, deported and harassed, while hundreds of Egyptian civilians were arrested in Cairo amid rumours of brewing political protests. Price gouging has left grassroots activists struggling to raise funds to cover accommodation and food.Inside the conference centre, known as the blue zone, plainclothes security officials have monitored the small authorised protests demanding climate justice and an end to fossil fuels. Government stooges interrupted panel events drawing attention to the plight of hunger striker Alaa Abd el-Fattah and Egypt’s 60,000 other political prisoners.Ukrainian activists who earlier this week interrupted a Russian delegation event with shouts of “Russia is guilty of war crimes” were also suspended.The four US activists, who had secured hotly sought-after tickets for Biden’s speech, said they wanted to call out false market solutions being pushed by the US and other western economies. “Joe Biden is no climate hero. We wanted to create a moment on behalf of all frontline communities in the global north and south to demand real climate solutions,” said Wefald, a 24-year-old climate activist from Brooklyn.After the brief interruption, they sat quietly through the remainder of the speech before being escorted out by UN security staff. John said: “The UN security said that our war call had put people’s lives in danger, and we were now deemed a security threat. Our badges were pulled and we had to leave.”According to an email from the UNFCCC observer relations team, Biden’s speech was a US government event, and they only learned about the suspension from the Guardian’s live blog. The appeal, which was supported by the Indigenous Peoples’ Caucus and several nonprofits, remains unresolved.Wind, who had been closely following negotiations on article 6, in which Indigenous people are fighting to ensure protections are built into carbon markets, said: “We are scared that carbon markets will take our lands away, and I should have been there making our concerns heard to the US delegation. I am worried about future Cops. It’s easy to label us as troublemakers so that our voices are not heard.”Johns, who raised money through small individual donations to participate in Cop27 and was following loss and damage negotiations, is also part of the international Earthrise Collective of Indigenous wisdom keepers and thought leaders conducting prayers and meditations inside the blue zone.“The world is falling apart but inside the destruction there is creation and a healthy liveable future, and we try to bring this energy to the chaotic negotiations. International spaces have been historically off limits to indigenous peoples, but different perspectives can hold a lot of power. I’ve been denied that basic right.”A UNFCCC spokesperson said no advocacy actions were allowed inside plenary and conference rooms and that the four were suspended for breaking the code of conduct. “A final decision on the suspension shall be made after further inquiry of the issue,” they said.The US delegation have been approached for comment."

Why the Democrats’ biggest wins weren’t in Washington DC,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/18/democrats-state-legislature-wins,"While Democrats staved off a red wave in Washington during the midterm elections, the party’s most significant victories came far away from the US Capitol. They were in state legislatures across the country with consequences that will be felt for years to come.Over the last decade, Republicans have quietly amassed power in state capitols, investing in races for state legislatures that can be decided by just a few hundred votes. It’s an investment that has paid off wildly. Since state legislatures draw electoral districts in many places, Republicans have used that advantage to entrench their power, drawing district lines that further guaranteed their majorities. They have also used those majorities to pass measures that make it harder to vote, strip LGBTQ+ protections, loosen gun laws and restrict access to abortion.In the midterms, however, Democrats flipped at least three state legislative chambers and held on to their majorities in several states where they were in jeopardy. The victories ended years of Democratic defeat and disappointment and caught even some Democrats off guard. It marked the first midterm election since at least 1934 in which the president’s party didn’t lose control of a single legislative chamber, according to the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC), which focuses on state legislative races.“We went into this cycle very clear-eyed. Knowing it was a presidential midterm and frankly expecting to lose seats,” said Jessica Post, president of the DLCC. “Republicans had everything in their favor. By all accounts, this election should have been a landslide for the Republicans. Instead, their so-called red wave looks more like a puddle.”In Michigan, Democrats took control of both chambers of the legislature for the first time in nearly 40 years. Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, was also re-elected to a second term, giving the party complete control of state government in one of America’s most politically competitive states.“I felt pretty confident we were gonna get one chamber and be looking at potentially picking up the chamber in two years. But it was surprising for me that we flipped both houses,” said Mallory McMorrow, a Democratic Michigan state senator who worked on flipping state legislative seats.Democrats also flipped control of the Minnesota senate, giving them complete control of state government there. In Pennsylvania, ballots are still being counted in two razor-thin state house races that will determine control of the state house.They also prevented Republicans from gaining supermajorities in the Wisconsin and North Carolina legislature, an extremely significant development that will prevent GOP-controlled bodies from overriding vetoes from Democratic governors there. Democrats held their majorities in state legislative chambers in Colorado, Maine, Oregon, Washington and New Mexico.“We felt those goals were certainly long shots. Many thought they were unattainable,” said Daniel Squadron, a former New York State senator who co-founded the States Project, which spent $60m towards electing Democrats in state legislative races. “In every chamber, we’ve either met or exceeded our electoral goals.”Those victories could play an important role in ensuring a free and fair election in two years. In 2020, Donald Trump tried to lean on GOP state legislative majorities in key battlegrounds like Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Arizona to try to overturn the results. The Democratic wins could also offer a critical safeguard against the US supreme court, which could soon endorse a fringe legal theory, backed by Republicans, that says state legislatures have virtually unchecked power to set rules over federal elections.Democrats and allies pointed to a combination of factors behind the wins.There were more competitive maps in place in Michigan and Pennsylvania this cycle, replacing districts Republicans drew a decade ago. Concerns about abortion access and competitive statewide races also drove voters to the polls. Strong candidate recruitment allowed Democrats to connect with voters. And deep investments allowed Democratic candidates to get out on the campaign trail early and launch an offense against Republican opponents.In 2020, Democrats failed to flip any of the chambers targeted to try to get a seat at the table in the redistricting process. In 2010, amid a juggernaut GOP effort, Democrats lost control of 20 chambers in a single night. In the 2014 midterms, 11 chambers flipped to Republican control.“Democrats can, in fact, win at the state legislative level. When we invest our dollars appropriately. When we utilize evidence-based tactics, and when we have candidates who can meet voters where they are, we proved that this year,” said Adam Pritzker, another co-founder of the States Project. “State legislative politics is not the minor leagues.”Republicans were massively outspent in state legislative races, Dee Duncan, the president of the Republican State Leadership Committee (RSLC), wrote in a memo to donors last week. Four outside left-leaning groups alone spent $125m on the races, dwarfing the $30m the RSLC invested. Duncan noted that the groups, including the DLCC, the States Project and Forward Majority, spent more in three states – Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania – than the RSLC spent across the country.“This influx in funding drove significant spending disparities in each state that were hard to overcome,” he wrote. “In every state where we lost a chamber or have potential to lose a chamber (Pennsylvania), Republicans did not win a single statewide election.”Christina Polizzi, a DLCC spokesperson, disputed that the RSLC was outspent. “The RSLC has absolutely no credibility on this. They have a long history of selective memory and flat out lying about their spending numbers,” she said in a statement. “Although they have nothing to show for it, the reality is they outraised and outspent the DLCC this cycle while still being only a fraction of the overall GOP spending in the states. They can’t blame their losses on the money – they lost because Republicans have bad policies and flawed candidates that the American people didn’t support.”Republicans did earn a few key wins in state races. In North Carolina, they flipped partisan control of the state supreme court. And in Ohio, they won a seat being vacated by a retiring GOP member who had been a swing vote. Those majorities could allow Republicans in those states to pass more aggressively gerrymandered maps, as well as anti-abortion laws.In Michigan, Kristen McDonald Rivet won one of the key state senate races that helped Democrats flip control of the chamber. From the moment she launched her campaign until just a few days before the election, she said, there were pundits who said she couldn’t win the seat, which borders the Saginaw Bay. Joe Biden narrowly carried the district by three points in 2020; McDonald Rivet wound up winning by six points.When she spoke with voters, McDonald Rivet would mention democracy and voting rights “all of these things that Democrats hold dear”, she said in an interview. But she also recognized the sense of economic unease in her district; families used to be able to work in a plant, raise their families and live “the Michigan dream to go to Disney World in the winter”. She and her husband have raised their six children in the district and her husband’s family has lived there for five generations.“It’s not about local politics. It was about people’s day-to-day. Local is not quite the right word,” she said. “I started a lot of my stump speeches with ‘you know politics doesn’t have to be this way.’ And it resonated, probably because I actually believe it.”Her campaign was also boosted by a strong party infrastructure, millions spent on media, and a massive grassroots effort. Her campaign knocked on 72,000 doors and had 7,500 individual donations, including hundreds of people in her district who had set up recurring donations, some for as little as $3.She was aided by Michigan Democrats like McMorrow, a state senator who gained national attention after a viral speech earlier this year and raised more than $2m to her Pac to help Democrats running for state legislative seats. In 2018, when she was a first-time candidate, McMorrow remembered being brushed off by donors who were more interested in statewide and federal races. That money, now, she said, allowed Democrats to hire paid field organizers and start campaigning earlier than Republican counterparts.“I think people really get it. And I think we were able to really make the case to people to say in a year when the Dobbs decision came down, really highlighted how important state legislatures are in a very tangible way. Because this is an issue that’s coming back to the states,” she said.Brian Munroe, a Democrat, knocked on 10,000 doors on his way to flipping a state house seat in Bucks county, Pennsylvania, a competitive area outside Philadelphia. “I heard from a lot of people, Republican, Democrat, independent, pro-Trump, not pro-Trump,” he said, recalling many conversations about abortion. “Everybody was tired of the divisiveness. I’m even talking about people with the Let’s Go Brandon flag out front.”Munroe initially was met with some skepticism from big donors, but won them over by pointing out that the district had been redrawn to include a township where he served on the board of supervisors. “Taking a risk can pay off. Not taking a risk will never pay off,” he added. “If all you do is focus on keeping the seats that you have and you’re not in the majority, then you’re always going to be relegated in the minority. That changed to a degree this cycle.”In Wisconsin, Lori Palmeri, the mayor of Oshkosh, won a competitive race for the state assembly that blocked Republicans from gaining a supermajority in the legislature that would have allowed them to override any vetoes from Tony Evers, a Democrat who was elected to a second term.“One of the things I heard the most at the doors was folks were fed up with the political polarization,” she said. “They wanted to see their legislators showing up and doing that work … The message is really from the voters. They really are not going to tolerate one-party rule.”Democrats and allies hope that the success they saw in 2022 will lead more Democrats to take state legislative races seriously.“My great hope is that our party will really start to understand that everything that affects people’s daily lives, including voting rights and the certification of US presidential elections, happens in states with Democratic trifecta control,” said Post of the DLCC.In the 48 hours after election day, more than 500 people expressed interest in running for office, said Amanda Litman, the executive director of Run for Something, which focuses on recruiting people to run for office.“Inspiring wins in long shot races inspire more people to take on long-shot races. It’s especially true when the candidates in those are young people, women, people of color. It compounds on itself,” she said."

Jeremy Hunt faces rebellion on Tory right over autumn statement,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/nov/18/jeremy-hunt-faces-rebellion-on-tory-right-over-autumn-statement,"Jeremy Hunt is facing a rebellion on the right of the Conservative party over his autumn statement after the former cabinet minister Esther McVey said she could not support the taxes rises while projects such as HS2 went ahead.Hinting that she could vote against the fiscal measures, she said the autumn statement could be the “final nail” for the party’s electoral chances.Other Conservative backbenchers to have questioned Hunt’s budgetary plans include McVey’s fellow rightwingers John Redwood, a supporter of Liz Truss and former cabinet minister, and Richard Drax.Redwood said Hunt should have considered “popular spending cuts” such as axing the £11bn to the Bank of England to deal with bond market turmoil, “ending the hotel bills for illegal migrants” and “stopping the anti-driver expensive changes to main roads”.Drax argued that raising taxes on businesses and workers “risks stifling the growth and productivity that he [Hunt] and I both want, and that would counter the recession we are now in”.Jacob Rees-Mogg called the package of tax rises the “easy option”, suggesting that Hunt should have looked at the “efficiency of government”.McVey told GB News that she could not support the decision to raise taxes for “squeezed” Britons. “What you don’t need is less of your earnings coming into your pocket,” she said. “I think – as various people have written – was this the end of the Tory party and is this going to be the nail in the coffin for the next general election … I can’t be supporting these rises, I said look at other places that you could have saved the money and got more value for the British people.”Michael Fabricant, another Conservative MP, has previously said Tories would “think twice” about supporting tax rises when HS2 was going ahead.Another critic was Tim Montgomerie, the founder of ConservativeHome and the Centre for Social Justice, who praised a Daily Mail front page headlined “Soak the Strivers”, saying: “I certainly won’t be voting Conservative at the next election.”Speaking earlier to broadcasters, Hunt denied that his economic strategy was un-Conservative, saying sound money was more important than low taxes.“What I would say to my Conservative colleagues is there is nothing Conservative about spending money that you haven’t got,” he said. “There is nothing Conservative about not tackling inflation, there is nothing Conservative about ducking difficult decisions that put the economy on track.“And we’ve done all of those things, and that is why this is a very Conservative package to make sure we sort out the economy.”He was defended by some other Tory MPs, with Sir Charles Walker telling Times Radio that he did not “particularly like” the contents of the autumn statement but they were necessary because the Conservatives were “in a hole”.“I won’t say good budget, because lots of people will be feeling very sore this morning,” he said. “But I think it was a necessary budget. And I think he delivered it with the gravitas that was required … It was a Conservative budget, despite what people are saying in the newspapers … it was a budget built around sound money and getting the public finances back into shape and getting this awful inflation down to manageable levels.”"
Security guards at Doha World Cup park claim they are paid just 35p an hour,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/nov/18/security-guards-doha-qatar-world-cup-park-claim-they-are-paid-just-35p-an-hour,"Migrant workers employed as security guards in a huge park that will be at the heart of Qatar’s World Cup festivities appear to be being paid as little as 35 pence an hour.The men are stationed across Al Bidda Park, a pristine green space adjoining the Fifa Fan Festival. Throughout the tournament Al Bidda Park will be packed with football fans enjoying the sweeping lawns, shaded picnic spots and views over Doha. The guards interviewed are not contracted to Fifa or deployed in the Festival.But long after fans have retreated to their hotels, the guards will stay on. In fact, it appears that fans are likely to see more of Doha in a week than these men will see in years. The guards say they work 12-hour shifts, and claim they usually get just one day off a month.“We just go between our duty and our accommodation,” said one holding out his phone. “You can show me anywhere in Qatar and I won’t know where it is.”The claims come on the eve of the start of the men’s Fifa World Cup, which is due to start on Sunday amid widespread international criticism of the host nation’s record on migrant worker and LGBTQ+ rights.In recent weeks Fifa and the Qatari authorities have battled to turn the spotlight away from workers’ and LGBTQ+ rights, with Fifa’s general secretary Gianni Infantino saying World Cup teams they should “focus on the football” and warning them against “handing out moral lessons to the rest of the world”. The Guardian’s findings are based on interviews carried out over the past few months with park guards working for Al Nasr Star Security Services. Guards and “marshals” employed by other companies also work in the park. There is no suggestion they are subject to the same claims over conditions.Analysis by The Guardian of workers’ pay notifications, corroborated by workers’ accounts of their working hours and pay, suggests that the guards are typically paid 1330 rials (£310) a month for 348 hours on duty, plus a small food allowance. It is understood that this includes 104 hours of overtime, for which they are paid 150 rials, which if correct equates to less than 35p an hour.Such working hours and overtime pay appear to be in breach of Qatar’s labour laws.The security guards say they know they are being underpaid but feel powerless to act. “It’s illegal, but the government keeps quiet, so what can we do?” claims one.“We put up with it because we need the money,” said another, revealing the predicament faced by many low-wage workers in Qatar. Others are grateful to at least have a job that pays more than they can make at home. “I’m happy because I get something … It’s a struggle but I don’t care because I don’t have anything,” one said.An Amnesty International report in March this year found exploitation in the private security sector was commonplace in Qatar.“Security guards are integral to the smooth running of the World Cup … No one should have to work under these conditions and anyone who has suffered abuse must be provided redress,” said Ella Knight, researcher on migrants’ labour rights at Amnesty.Knight suggested the Guardian’s findings are, “another clear example of the shortcomings of the reform process and how remaining gaps in enforcement of laws continue to afflict the lives of migrant workers in the country.”Qatar’s labour reforms should mean the Al Bidda Park guards are able to transfer to a better-paying job, but the workers say in practice it is very difficult, and believe that they still need their employer’s permission to seek other work. “If they gave [permission] … 90% would have changed jobs,” said one. “Even when we are sleeping, we dream of changing our job,” added a colleague.Separately they all claim they had been forced to pay illegal recruitment fees – in the region of £1,175-£1,650 – to recruitment agents in their home countries to secure their jobs, effectively forcing them to work for up to five months just to repay the fee. And, while some football fans will enjoy the most opulent hotels in the world, some of these men sleep in bunk beds in over-crowded labour camps on the edge of the desert.The Guardian visited one camp which houses the guards and found rooms with four bunk beds crammed end-to-end around the edge of a tiny space. There were no lockers, so the men shared their beds with their belongings or a suitcase. Cooking utensils were stuffed under the beds. Two large grimy kitchens and foul-smelling toilet cubicles stood outside. One guard said the toilets were so bad in his camp that he preferred to wait and use the ones at the park.It is a world few football fans will see. Turn off a four-lane highway out of Doha and on to a potholed road and the only traffic is an endless flow of buses and minivans shipping men to and from their workplace. The road leads to dozens of accommodation blocks amid wasteland covered in litter. Outside each block, men sit on rocks scrolling through their phones while stray dogs play in the dust. A homemade basketball hoop is the only sign of normal life.Today the Building and Wood Workers’ International, a trade union which has worked in partnership with the Qatari authorities to improve workers’ rights in the country, issued a strong-worded statement saying, ‘there is no sign that sustainable change [for migrant workers] is forthcoming.’A Qatari government official said, “Over the past decade, extensive action has been taken to combat exploitative labour practices and provide accessible channels for workers to make complaints … When violations are recorded, corrective action is taken, and offending companies are penalised.”The official said over 420,000 workers have changed their employer since a new law was introduced in 2020, which made it easier to change jobs. Last month, 3,712 labour inspections were carried out, he added, and 97% of workers are covered by the wage protection system, “which ensures all wages are paid in full and on time.”“Systemic change does not happen in an instant – it takes time to transform a labour market. In other countries, this was a decades-long process, and in many countries – including in Europe – this process is still ongoing.“Hundreds of thousands of workers have benefited from our labour reforms, and our commitment to improving the lives of every expatriate who has made Qatar a second home will continue long after the World Cup,” the official said.The managing director of the Al Nasr Star Group confirmed the guards work 12-hour shifts but said that they get two hours’ break each day and one day off a week. The security guards who spoke to the Guardian claim they do not routinely get breaks during their working day, although one worker did say he was given breaks from work during the summer months.The company did not respond to repeated requests for a written response to the allegations put to the Guardian by its workers or provide timesheets or information on pay for security guards working at Al Bidda."
"‘It’s not my shame, it’s his’: Somerset woman speaks out on childhood abuse by brother",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/nov/18/somerset-woman-speaks-out-on-childhood-abuse-by-brother,"A woman who was sexually abused by her older brother half a century ago when she was a young girl has waived her right to anonymity to describe her decades of torment and to encourage other survivors of familial abuse to come forward.Liz Roberts, 59, a former police officer, said the abuse carried out by Andrew Herbert when she was about eight had led to a life of self-loathing and shame punctuated by episodes of depression, anxiety and self-harm.“I felt unloved, unlovable, weak and stupid,” Roberts said. “I felt guilt and shame. It’s important now to put the shame where it belongs. It’s not my shame, it’s his. I’ve watched him for the last 50 years living a big life while I’ve been in the shadows, shrinking away. If I don’t speak out, he’ll reinvent himself and carry on and I’ll go back into the darkness.”Describing familial sexual abuse as a “hidden scourge”, she said: “I’m aware this is happening to some kid right now and there are thousands of people whose lives are being poisoned.”Herbert, 67, from Goodrich in Herefordshire, was given a two-year community order at Bristol crown court on 4 November after admitting 10 counts of indecent assault against Roberts and a second girl in the early 1970s. He was ordered to undertake sex offender treatment, do 225 hours of unpaid work, and will be subject to a curfew and restraining orders. The judge, Julian Lambert, said: “These were very serious offences with the most severe effects.”Roberts, who was brought up in south Bristol in a strict Catholic family, said Herbert was often in trouble as a boy and young man, always pushing boundaries.When she was about seven or eight and her brother about 15, he sexually abused her over a number of months. “He did it in a wheedling, pleading kind of way and it was terrifying,” she said.“I felt scared and miserable all the time. I remember smells, touch, feel. You don’t know words like sexual abuse but you know it shouldn’t be happening. It was compounded by the fact it was done in a family environment where you’re supposed to feel safe.”It was only during the court case that Roberts realised her brother played on her love of horses, inventing a game called “bucking broncos” in which he would let her ride on his back. The game would turn into abuse. “I didn’t realise until the trial that he had groomed me in that way. That was clever.”Roberts went on to become a police officer in Bristol, then worked as a rep for a pharmaceutical company and now is the managing director of an online learning company. She is a mother of two and grandmother of one.Over the years she has had an eating disorder and low self-esteem and trust issues. “I get flashbacks. It seems to get easier and then something will happen and, whoosh, it’s all back again. If you have a stressful situation you overreact, you’re on hyper alert. At the first sign of trouble you go into meltdown.”When she first confronted her brother several years ago, he began to cry. “And then he went on about his problems. I boxed it all back up and carried on.”Roberts began intense psychotherapy and she wrote to Herbert, who was married and a father, detailing what she felt about the abuse. She ended: “I’m asking you to leave me alone. I never want to hear from you again.”To her surprise, he wrote back, accepting he had abused her. She realised she had evidence and went to the police. In court, he claimed he was suffering from a “tsunami” of guilt. “But honestly it was a tsunami of self-pity. He’s just been caught,” Roberts said.As a police officer in the 80s, Roberts said, she saw first-hand that survivors of sexual abuse were often not believed or taken seriously. But she has been impressed by the support she has been given by the police, the Crown Prosecution Service and organisations that provide help and counselling. “There’s a lot of support for survivors,” she said.Roberts said she hoped her story would give confidence to other survivors to come forward, and she plans to campaign on the issue. “Familial sexual abuse is a hidden scourge and I think it happens far more often than we think. People like Andrew get away with it by passing their guilt and shame and literally hiding in plain sight.”Roberts, who now lives in west Somerset, said she was determined to “sort this” for the little girl abused by her brother. Pointing to a photo of herself as a seven-year-old feeding a horse on a beach, she said: “I’m telling that girl it’s safe now, he can’t hurt me any more, he won’t hurt anyone else. He’s the one who did wrong.”"
"I’ve kissed a Tory and I’m not ashamed, Keir Starmer reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/nov/18/keir-starmer-i-kissed-a-tory-and-not-ashamed-labour,"Keir Starmer has tried to reveal a little more about himself, confessing that he has broken the “never kiss a Tory rule” and that he is not ashamed.The Labour party leader said he was “not tribal” when it came to personal relationships and politics because he entered the political scene relatively late in life. Speaking to Times Radio, he suggested only people in the political bubble were focused on maintaining division.Asked about other Labour figures who wear “never kissed a Tory” badges, Starmer said: “I’m afraid I’ve broken that rule. I’m not tribal. I’m on very good terms with many Tory MPs. I’m not ashamed about it and I’ve got very good friends who are Tories and they’ve been very, very good friends of mine for a very, very long time, and long may that last.”Over the summer, Lucy Powell, a member of Starmer’s shadow cabinet, faced criticism after she was pictured wearing a T-shirt with the phrase “never kissed a Tory” at Manchester pride.The Tory MP Sara Britcliffe complained that the phrase created a sense of “us versus them”, while James Cleverly, then the education secretary, joked that if Powell had asked nicely then “one [Tory] will say yes eventually”.Starmer described his attempts to keep life “as normal as possible” for his family and said he did his best to spend time with his children.He said: “I don’t want to be the man in 10 years’ time saying ‘I wish I’d spent more time with my children’. I’ve got a rule of a hard stop on a Friday at 6pm. I won’t be doing any work; I’ll be at home.”"
Footage of cars hitting pedestrians at Bradford zebra crossing ‘horrifies’ MP,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/18/footage-of-cars-hitting-pedestrians-at-bradford-zebra-crossing-horrifies-mp,"An MP has said he is “absolutely horrified” to see footage of drivers ploughing into pedestrians at a zebra crossing where there have been a series of accidents in recent years.The Labour MP Imran Hussain said he was concerned about “accident blackspots” in his Bradford East constituency after clips of the collisions were shared by the television presenter Jeremy Vine.One video showed a pedestrian being thrown into the air by a car that failed to stop, while two others showed motorists driving into cyclists in broad daylight. A fourth clip showed a woman knocked to the ground by a car that crossed at speed at night.The footage has been viewed more than 40,000 times online after being shared by Vine, who described them as examples of “petrosexuals” abusing public spaces. Posting one video, he tweeted: “What the HELL is going on with this zebra???”Bradford council said on Friday it understood local concerns about the crossing on Horton Grange Road, about a mile from the city centre, and would carry out an immediate inspection.A council spokesperson said it was awaiting funding to convert the location to a signalled crossing with traffic lights and that this work would take place “as soon as we can”.It said improvement works were carried out four years ago to replace its Belisha beacons with high-visibility LED units and enhanced white road markings. It is unclear why the crossing appears to have become such an accident hotspot in recent years.Hussain said he had been pressing the council and West Yorkshire police to improve the safety of roads in the city that some drivers use “as rat runs and racetracks”.He added: “I’m absolutely horrified to see this catalogue of incidents where cars have hit pedestrians on what is a well-marked and visible zebra crossing on Horton Grange Road, and it is evidently clear that we need to see much tougher action against those who seemingly have no problem with violating the rules of the road.“For too long, a minority of dangerous drivers in Bradford have been blighting Bradford’s roads and making the lives of the majority of responsible road users an absolute misery, and I’ve been pressing both Bradford council and West Yorkshire police to implement a number of road safety measures at accident blackspots in my constituency, while also pressing ministers to impose tougher sentences for dangerous drivers.”"
