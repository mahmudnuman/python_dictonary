    "Indications": "This is indicated in combination with other antiretrovirals or alone for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection.",
    "Pharmacology": "Abacavir is a carbocyclic synthetic nucleoside analogue and an antiviral agent. Intracellularly, abacavir is converted by cellular enzymes to the active metabolite carbovir triphosphate, an analogue of deoxyguanosine-5'-triphosphate (dGTP). Carbovir triphosphate inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) both by competing with the natural substrate dGTP and by its incorporation into viral DNA. Viral DNA growth is terminated because the incorporated nucleotide lacks a 3'-OH group, which is needed to form the 5′ to 3′ phosphodiester linkage essential for DNA chain elongation.Lamivudine is a synthetic nucleoside analogue and is phosphorylated intracellularly to its active 5'-triphosphate metabolite, lamivudine triphosphate (L-TP). This nucleoside analogue is incorporated into viral DNA by HIV reverse transcriptase and HBV polymerase, resulting in DNA chain termination.Zidovudine, a structural analog of thymidine, is a prodrug that must be phosphorylated to its active 5′-triphosphate metabolite, zidovudine triphosphate (ZDV-TP). It inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) via DNA chain termination after incorporation of the nucleotide analogue. It competes with the natural substrate dGTP and incorporates itself into viral DNA. It is also a weak inhibitor of cellular DNA polymerase α and γ.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Recommended dosage for adults and pediatric patients weighing at least 40 kg: The recommended dosage is one tablet taken orally twice daily with or without food. Due to fixed-dose tablet and cannot be dose adjusted, this is not recommended for:\n\nPediatric patients who weigh less than 40 kg.\nPatients with creatinine clearance less than 50 ml/minute\nPatients with mild hepatic impairment.",
    "Interaction": "Abacavir: In a trial of 11 HIV-1-infected subjects receiving methadone-maintenance therapy with 600 mg twice daily (twice the currently recommended dose), oral methadone clearance increased. This alteration will not result in a methadone dose modification in the majority of patients; however, an increased methadone dose may be required in a small number of patients.Lamivudine: Coadministration of single doses of lamivudine and sorbitol resulted in a sorbitol dose-dependent reduction in lamivudine exposures. When possible, avoid use of sorbitol-containing medicines with lamivudine-containing medicinesZidovudine: Concomitant use of zidovudine with the following drugs should be avoided since an antagonistic relationship has been demonstrated in vitro: Stavudine, Doxorubicin, Nucleoside analogues, e.g., ribavirin",
    "Contraindications": "This is contraindicated in patients:\n\nWho have the HLA-B*5701 allele\nWith prior hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, lamivudine, or zidovudine.\nWith moderate or severe hepatic impairment.",
    "Side Effects": "The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence at least 10%) in clinical trials were nausea, headache, malaise and fatigue, and nausea and vomiting.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of this preparation in pregnant women. This drug should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefits outweigh the risks. Women infected with HIV should be instructed not to breastfeed due to potential for HIV transmission.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have occurred with abacavir, a component of this preparation. These hypersensitivity reactions have included multi-organ failure and anaphylaxis and typically occurred within the first 6 weeks of treatment with abacavir (median time to onset was 9 days); although abacavir hypersensitivity reactions have occurred any time during. Patients who carry the HLA-B*5701 allele are at a higher risk of abacavir hypersensitivity reactions; although, patients who do not carry the HLA-B*5701 allele have developed hypersensitivity reactions. Hypersensitivity to abacavir was reported in approximately 206 (8%) of 2,670 patients in 9 clinical trials with abacavir-containing products where HLA-B*5701 screening was not performed. The incidence of suspected abacavir hypersensitivity reactions in clinical trials was 1% when subjects carrying the HLA-B*5701 allele were excluded. In any patient treated with abacavir, the clinical diagnosis of hypersensitivity reaction must remain the basis of clinical decision making.",

    "name": "Acarbose",
    "link": "https://medex.com.bd/generics/27/acarbose",
    "Indications": "Acarbose is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.",
    "Pharmacology": "In contrast to sulfonylureas, Acarbose does not enhance insulin secretion. The antihyperglycemic action of acarbose results from a competitive, reversible inhibition of pancreatic alpha-amylase and membrane-bound intestinal alpha-glucoside hydrolase enzymes. Pancreatic alpha-amylase hydrolyzes complex starches to oligosaccharides in the lumen of the small intestine, while the membrane-bound intestinal alpha-glucosidases hydrolyze oligosaccharides, trisaccharides, and disaccharides to glucose and other monosaccharides in the brush border of the small intestine. In diabetic patients, this enzyme inhibition results in a delayed glucose absorption and a lowering of postprandial hyperglycemia. Because its mechanism of action is different, the effect of Acarbose to enhance glycemic control is additive to that of sulfonylureas, insulin or metformin when used in combination. In addition, Acarbose diminishes the insulinotropic and weight-increasing effects of sulfonylureas. Acarbose has no inhibitory activity against lactase and consequently would not be expected to induce lactose intolerance.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "The recommended starting dosage of Acarbose is 25 mg given orally three times daily at the start (with the first bite) of each main meal. However, some patients may benefit from more gradual dose titration to minimize gastrointestinal side effects. This may be achieved by initiating treatment at 25 mg once per day and subsequently increasing the frequency of administration to achieve 25 mg t.i.d. Maintenance Dosage Once a 25 mg t.i.d. dosage regimen is reached, dosage of Acarbose should be adjusted at 4–8 week intervals based on one-hour postprandial glucose or glycosylated hemoglobin levels, and on tolerance. The dosage can be increased from 25 mg t.i.d. to 50 mg t.i.d. Some patients may benefit from further increasing the dosage to 100 mg t.i.d. The maintenance dose ranges from 50 mg t.i.d. to 100 mg t.i.d.",
    "Interaction": "Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of blood glucose control. These drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel-blocking drugs, and isoniazid. When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving Acarbose, the patient should be closely observed for loss of blood glucose control. When such drugs are withdrawn from patients receiving Acarbose in combination with sulfonylureas or insulin, patients should be observed closely for any evidence of hypoglycemia.Patients Receiving Sulfonylureas or Insulin: Sulfonylurea agents or insulin may cause hypoglycemia. Acarbose given in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin may cause a further lowering of blood glucose and may increase the potential for hypoglycemia. If hypoglycemia occurs, appropriate adjustments in the dosage of these agents should be made. Very rarely, individual cases of hypoglycemic shock have been reported in patients receiving Acarbose therapy in combination with sulfonylureas and/or insulin.",
    "Contraindications": "Acarbose is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug. Precose is contraindicated in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis or cirrhosis. Acarbose is also contraindicated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, colonic ulceration, partial intestinal obstruction or in patients predisposed to intestinal obstruction. In addition, Acarbose is contraindicated in patients who have chronic intestinal diseases associated with marked disorders of digestion or absorption and in patients who have conditions that may deteriorate as a result of increased gas formation in the intestine.",
    "Side Effects": "Diarrhea, gas, upset stomach, constipation, or stomach pain may occur in the first few weeks of treatment as your body adjusts to this medication but usually improve with time. Follow your prescribed diet to help lessen these side effects. If any of these effects persist or worsen, tell your doctor or pharmacist promptly.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy Category B. The safety of Acarbose in pregnant women has not been established. A small amount of radioactivity has been found in the milk of lactating rats after administration of radiolabeled acarbose. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, Acarbose should not be administered to a nursing woman.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Because of its mechanism of action, Acarbose when administered alone should not cause hypoglycemia in the fasted or postprandial state. Sulfonylurea agents or insulin may cause hypoglycemia. Because Acarbose given in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin will cause a further lowering of blood glucose, it may increase the potential for hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia does not occur in patients receiving metformin alone under usual circumstances of use, and no increased incidence of hypoglycemia was observed in patients when Acarbose was added to metformin therapy.Oral glucose (dextrose), whose absorption is not inhibited by Acarbose, should be used instead of sucrose (cane sugar) in the treatment of mild to moderate hypoglycemia. Sucrose, whose hydrolysis to glucose and fructose is inhibited by Acarbose, is unsuitable for the rapid correction of hypoglycemia. Severe hypoglycemia may require the use of either intravenous glucose infusion or glucagon injection.",
    "Overdose Effects": "Unlike sulfonylureas or insulin, an overdose of Acarbose will not result in hypoglycemia. An overdose may result in transient increases in flatulence, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort which shortly subside. In cases of overdosage the patient should not be given drinks or meals containing carbohydrates (polysaccharides, oligosaccharides and disaccharides) for the next 4–6 hours.",
    "Therapeutic Class": "Alpha-Glucosidase inhibitor",
    "Storage Conditions": "Store below 25° C. Protect from moisture.",
    "Use in Special Populations": "Pediatric Use: safety and effectiveness of Acarbose in pediatric patients have not been established.Geriatric Use: of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of Acarbose in the United States, 27% were 65 and over, while 4% were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects."

    "Indications": "Acetazolamide is indicated in open angle glaucoma, secondary glaucoma and as an adjuvant in the treatment of edema and epilepsy.",
    "Pharmacology": "Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. This enzyme catalyzes the reversible reaction involving the hydration of carbon-di-oxide and the dehydration of carbonic acid. In the eye, this inhibitory action of Acetazolamide decreases the secretion of aqueous humor and results in a drop in intraocular pressure, a reaction considered desirable in case of glaucoma. Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in the central nervous system appears to retard abnormal paroxysmal and excessive discharge from central nervous system neurons. So, Acetazolamide is also used as an adjuvant in the treatment of epilepsy.",

    "Pharmacology": "Acetylcysteine is a mucolytic agent that reduces the viscosity of secretions probably by the splitting of disulphide bonds in mucoproteins. Moreover it gives antisecretory effect. These results in clearing of respiratory ducts and facilitate breathing. Acetylcysteine also has anti-oxidant properties by reacting with free radicals and also by serving as a precursor to glutathione, which is an important intra and extra-cellular antioxidant. By providing anti-oxidant action, it neutralizes exogenous and endogenous oxidants, which in fact act as pathogens in respiratory inflammations.",

If a tent or croupette must be used, the recommended dose is the volume of acetylcysteine (using 20%) that will maintain a very heavy mist in the tent or croupette for the desired period. Administration for intermittent or continuous prolonged periods, including overnight, may be desirable.** Direct Instillation: When used by direct instillation, 1-2 ml of a 20% solution may be given as often as every hour. When used for the routine nursing care of patients with tracheostomy, 1-2 ml of a 20% solution may be given every 1-4 hours by instillation into the tracheostomy.",
    "Interaction": "The thiol group of Acetylcysteine can reduce the efficacy of certain antibiotics such as ampicillin, tetracycline, macrolides, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides and amphotericin. Concomitant use of Acetylcysteine and amoxicillin will increase the level of the antibiotic in tissues. It is, therefore, advisable to use the two medicines 2 hours apart from each other. Acetylcysteine can increase the inhibitory effect of thrombocyte aggregation and vasodialation by nitroglycerine.",

    "Indications": "Acitretin is indicated in severe extensive psoriasis which is resistant to other forms of therapy, palmo-plantar pustular psoriasis, severe congenital ichthyosis, severe Darier’s disease (keratosis follicularis).",
    "Pharmacology": "Acitretin is a retinoid, an aromatic analogue of vitamin A. The mechanism of action of acitretin is unknown, however, evidence exists for a wide range of actions at various cellular and subcellular levels. These include regulation of RNA/DNA synthesis, modulation of factors which influence epidermal proliferation, modification of glycoprotein synthesis and modulation of the immune response. Whatever the exact mechanism of action, the most prominent effect of acitretin is a modulation of cellular differentiation in the epidermis which re-establishes a more normal pattern of cell growth.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "Adult and elderly: Initial daily dose should be 25 mg or 30 mg for 2 to 4 weeks. After this initial treatment period the involved areas of the skin should show a marked response and/or side-effects should be apparent. In general, a daily dosage of 25-50 mg taken for a further 6 to 8 weeks to achieve optimal therapeutic results. However, it may be necessary in some cases to increase the dose up to a maximum of 75 mg/day.In patients with Darier’s disease a starting dose of 10 mg may be appropriate. The dose should be increased cautiously as isomorphic reactions may occur. Patients with severe congenital ichthyosis and severe Darier’s disease may require therapy beyond 3 months. The lowest effective dosage, not exceeding 50mg/day, should be given. Continuous use beyond 6 months is contra-indicated as only limited clinical data are available on patients treated beyond this length of time.Children: The daily dosage is about 0.5mg/kg. Higher doses (up to 1mg/kg daily) may be necessary in some cases for limited periods, but only up to a maximum of 35 mg/day.",
    "Interaction": "Existing data suggests that concurrent intake of acitretin with ethanol led to the formation of etretinate. Concomitant administration of methotrexate, tetracyclines or vitamin A and other retinoids with acitretin is contraindicated. In concurrent treatment with phenytoin, it must be remembered that Acitretin partially reduces the protein binding of phenytoin. Low dose progesterone-only products (minipills) may be an inadequate method of contraception during acitretin therapy, Investigations into the effect of acitretin on the protein binding of anticoagulants of the coumarin type (warfarin) revealed no interaction.",
    "Contraindications": "Acitretin is highly teratogenic and must not be used by women who are pregnant. The same applies to women of childbearing potential unless strict contraception is practiced 4 weeks before, during and for 2 years after treatment. The use of Acitretin is contra-indicated in women who are breast feeding.Acitretin is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic or renal impairment and in patients with chronic abnormally elevated blood lipid values. Concomitant administration of Acitretin with other retinoids or Vitamin A is contra-indicated due to the risk of hypervitaminosis A. Acitretin is contra-indicated in cases of hypersensitivity to the preparation (acitretin or excipients) or to other retinoids. Patients with rare glucose-galactosemalabsorption should not take this medicine.",
    "Side Effects": "Adverse effects are seen in most patients receiving acitretin. Most of the clinical side-effects of Acitretin are dose-related and are usually well-tolerated at the recommended dosages. However, the toxic dose of Acitretin is close to the therapeutic dose and most patients experience some side-effects during theinitial period whilst dosage is being adjusted. The skin and mucous membranes are most commonly affected. An initial worsening of psoriasis symptoms issometimes seen at the beginning of the treatment period.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Acitretin is contraindicated in pregnant women or nursing mother. It is highly teratogenic. Its use is contraindicated in women who might become pregnant during or within 2 years of the cessation of treatment.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "The risk of giving birth to a deformed child is exceptionally high if Acitretin is taken before or during pregnancy, no matter for how long or at what dosage. Women of childbearing potential must not receive blood from patients being treated with acitretin. Donation of blood by a patient being treated with acitretin is prohibited during and for two years after completion of treatment with acitretin. The effects of UV light are enhanced by retinoid therapy; therefore patients should avoid excessive exposure to sunlight. Hepatic function should be checked before starting treatment with Acitretin, every 1-2 weeks for the first 2 months after commencement and then every 3 months during treatment. Serum cholesterol and serum triglycerides (fasting values) must be monitored before starting treatment, one month after the commencement and then every 3 months during treatment, especially in high-risk patients and during long-term treatment. Retinoids can alter glucose tolerance, blood sugar levels should therefore be checked. Patients should be warned of the possibility of alopecia. Decreased night vision has been reported with acitretin therapy. Patients with severe headache, nausea, vomiting, and visual disturbances should discontinue acitretin immediately.",
    "Overdose Effects": "Manifestations of acute Vitamin A toxicity include severe headache, vertigo, nausea or vomiting, drowsiness, irritability and pruritus. Signs and symptoms of accidental or deliberate overdosage with Acitretin would probably be similar. Specific treatment is unnecessary because of the low acute toxicity of the preparation.",

    "Indications": "It is indicated for the maintenance treatment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).",
    "Pharmacology": "Aclidinium bromide: Aclidinium bromide is a long-acting anti-muscarinic agent, which is often referred to as an anticholinergic. It has similar affinity to the subtypes of muscarinic receptors M1 to M5. In the airways, it exhibits pharmacological effects through inhibition of M3 receptors at the smooth muscle leading to bronchodilation. The competitive and reversible nature of antagonism was shown with human and animal origin receptors and isolated organ preparations. In preclinical, in vitro as well as in vivo studies, prevention of acetylcholine-induced bronchoconstriction effects was dose-dependent and lasted longer than 24 hours. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. The bronchodilation following inhalation of aclidinium bromide is predominantly a site-specific effect.Formoterol fumarate: Formoterol fumarate is a long-acting selective beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist (LABA) (beta 2-agonist). Inhaled formoterol fumarate acts locally in the lung as a bronchodilator. The pharmacologic effects of beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including formoterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3', 5'-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "For oral inhalation only. Should be taken by revolizer. 400 mcg/12 meg, twice daily (One inhalation capsule in the morning and one in the evening ). Do not take more than one inhalation twice daily.",
    "Interaction": "Use of other adrenergic by any route may potentiate the effect of this combination.

Use with caution.\nDiuretics: Electrocardiographic changes and/or hypokalemia associated with non-potassium sparing diuretics may worsen with concomitant beta2-agonists. Use with caution.\nMonoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants: Use with extreme caution. May potentiate effect of formoterol fumarate on cardiovascular system.\nBeta-blockers: Use with caution and only when medically necessary.\nAnticholinergics: May interact additively with concomitantly used anticholinergic medications. Avoid administrations of this combination with other anticholinergic-containing drugs.",

    "Side Effects": "Most common adverse reactions (incidence 3% and more common than with placebo) include: upper respiratory tract infection and headache.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Aclitol or its individual components, formoterol fumarate or aclidinium bromide, in pregnant women to inform drug-associated risks. There are no available data on the effects of aclidinium bromide, or formoterol fumarate on the breastfed child or on milk production or presence in human milk.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Asthma-related death: Long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists as monotherapy (without an inhaled corticosteroid) for asthma increase the risk of serious asthma-related events.\nDo not initiate in acutely deteriorating COPD or to treat acute symptoms.\nDo not use in combination with additional medicine containing a LABA because of risk of overdose.\nIf paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, discontinue this combination and institute alternative therapy.\nUse with caution in patients with convulsive disorders, thyrotoxicosis, diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis.\nBe alert to hypokalemia and hyperglycemia.\nUse with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma and instruct patients to contact a physician immediately if symptoms occur.\nWorsening urinary retention may occur.

    "Contraindications": "Febrile diarrhoea. Medicinal charcoal should not be taken in the case of intoxication with corrosive substances (strong acids and alkalis) as this would complicate diagnostic measures eg, oesophagoscopy and gastroscopy.",
    "Side Effects": "As most undesirable effects are based on post-marketing spontaneous reporting, precise frequency estimation is not possible. No adverse reactions to Ultracarbon are known to occur if taken in the recommended dosage to treat the diarrhoea. After very high doses as those taken in intoxications, constipation and intestinal obstruction (mechanical ileus) may occur in individual cases; this can be prevented by administering saline laxatives (eg, sodium sulfate). As medicinal charcoal is excreted in unchanged form, the stools turn black (discoloured faeces) after intake of Ultracarbon tablets.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "No data found",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Several poisons and drugs require different or additional measures. Medicinal charcoal is not effective in intoxications with organic and inorganic salts as well as solvents eg, for instance, lithium, thallium, cyanide, iron salts, methanol, ethanol and ethylene glycol. Different measures are in these cases indicated to eliminate the poison (eg, gastric lavage). In many intoxications, a specific antidote must be administered additionally to medicinal charcoal (eg, acetylcysteine in paracetamol poisoning). To avoid aspiration in unconscious patients, a physician should administer the suspension of Ultracarbon tablets in water by gastric tube.In patients undergoing multiple dose, activated charcoal therapy after intoxication, gastrointestinal sounds should be monitored frequently to assess peristaltic action.Ultracarbon should not be used in cases of poisoning with pesticides.",
    "Overdose Effects": "Activated charcoal is well tolerated and due to its lack of toxicity, overdose requiring treatment is unlikely. Should symptoms of overdose like constipation and intestinal obstruction (mechanical ileus) occur, a saline laxative may be administered to enhance the elimination of Ultracarbon tablets.",

There is no experience of the effect of Acyclovir on human fertility.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Acyclovir IV injection is intended for intravenous infusion only and should not be used through any other route. Reconstituted Acyclovir IV Infusion has a pH of approximately 11.0 and should not be administered by mouth. Acyclovir IV injection as infusion must be given over a period of at least one hour in order to avoid renal tubular damage. It should not be administered as a bolus injection. Acyclovir IV infusion must be accompanied by adequate hydration. Since maximum urine concentration occurs within the first few hours following infusion, particular attention should be given to establish sufficient urine ‑ow during that period. Concomitant use of other nephrotoxic drugs, pre-existing renal disease and dehydration increase the risk of further renal impairment by Acyclovir. As Acyclovir has been associated with reversible encephalopathic changes, it should be used with caution in patients with neurological abnormalities, significant hypoxia or serious renal, hepatic or electrolyte abnormalities.",
    "Overdose Effects": "Overdosage of intravenous Acyclovir has resulted in elevations of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and subsequent renal failure.

    "Pharmacology": "Aciclovir is a synthetic purine derivative. Aciclovir exerts its antiviral effect on Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and Varicella-zoster virus by interfering with DNA synthesis and inhibiting viral replication. In cells infected with herpes virus, the antiviral activity of Aciclovir appears to depend principally on the intracellular conversion of the drug to Aciclovir Triphosphate. Aciclovir is converted to Aciclovir Monophosphate principally via virus coded thymidine kinase; the monophosphate is phosphorylated to the diphosphate via cellular guanylate kinase and then via another cellular enzyme to the triphosphate, which is the pharmacologically active form of the drug. 15-30% of an oral dose of the drug is absorbed from Gl tract. Peak plasma concentrations usually occur within 1.5-2 hours after oral administration. It is widely distributed into body tissues and fluids including the brain, saliva, lungs, liver, muscle, spleen, uterus, vaginal mucosa and secretions, CSF, and herpetic vesicular fluid.

    "Pharmacology": "Acyclovir is an antiviral drug active against herpes simplex virus. Acyclovir is a synthetic purine nucleoside analogue with cell culture and in vivo inhibitory activity against HSV types 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2). The inhibitory activity of acyclovir is highly selective due to its affinity for the enzyme thymidine kinase (TK) encoded by HSV. This viral enzyme converts acyclovir into acyclovir monophosphate, a nucleotide analogue. The monophosphate is further converted into diphosphate by cellular guanylate kinase and into triphosphate by a number of cellular enzymes. In cell culture, acyclovir triphosphate stops replication of herpes viral DNA. This inhibition is accomplished in 3 ways: 1) competitive inhibition of viral DNA polymerase, 2) incorporation into and termination of the growing viral DNA chain, and 3) inactivation of the viral DNA polymerase.",

    "Pharmacology": "Adalimumab is a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody specific for human tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Adalimumab binds specifically to TNF-alpha and blocks its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. Adalimumab also lyses surface TNF expressing cells in vitro in the presence of complement. TNF is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses. Elevated levels of TNF are found in the synovial fluid of patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis, Psoriatic Arthritis, and Ankylosing Spondylitis and play an important role in both the pathologic inflammation and the joint destruction that are hallmarks of these diseases. Increased levels of TNF are also found in psoriasis plaques. In Plaque Psoriasis, treatment with Adalimumab may reduce the epidermal thickness and infiltration of inflammatory cells.",
    "Dosage & Administration": "The cream should be topically applied 5 times per day for 5 days. Therapy should be initiated as early as possible after the first signs and symptoms.",
    "Interaction": "Abatacept: Increased risk of serious infection Anakinra: Increased risk of serious infection Live vaccines: Adalimumab use should be avoided",

    "Side Effects": "The most common adverse reaction with Adalimumab was injection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, hemorrhage, pain or swelling). The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of Adalimumab in rheumatoid arthritis were clinical flare reaction, rash and pneumonia. \n\nOther adverse reactions of Adalimumab includes- Gastrointestinal disorders: Diverticulitis, large bowel perforations including perforations associated with diverticulitis and appendiceal perforations associated with appendicitis, pancreatitis.\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: Pyrexia.\nHepato-biliary disorders: Liver failure, hepatitis.\nImmune system disorders: Sarcoidosis.\nNeoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps): Merkel Cell Carcinoma (neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin). \nNervous system disorders: Demyelinating disorders (e.g., optic neuritis, Guillain-Barré syndrome).\nCerebrovascular accident Respiratory disorders: Interstitial lung disease, including pulmonary fibrosis.\nPulmonary embolism Skin reactions: Stevens Johnson Syndrome, cutaneous vasculitis, erythema multiforme, new or worsening psoriasis (all sub-types including pustular and palmoplantar), alopecia.\nVascular disorders: Systemic vasculitis, deep vein thrombosis.",
    "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy Category B. Adequate and well controlled studies with Adalimumab have not been conducted in pregnant women. Adalimumab is an IgG1 monoclonal antibody and IgG1 is actively transferred across the placenta during the third trimester of pregnancy. Limited data from published literature indicate that Adalimumab is present in low levels in human milk and is not likely to be absorbed by a breastfed infant. However, no data is available on the absorption of Adalimumab from breast milk in newborn or preterm infants. Caution should be exercised when Adalimumab is administered to a nursing woman.",
    "Precautions & Warnings": "Serious infections: Adalimumab should not be started during an active infection. If an infection develops, should be carefully monitored and if infection becomes serious Adalimumab should be stopped.\nInvasive fungal infections: For patients who develop a systemic illness on Adalimumab, empiric antifungal therapy should be considered for those who reside or travel to regions where mycoses are endemic\nMalignancies: Incidence of malignancies was greater in Adalimumab-treated patients than in controls\nAnaphylaxis or serious allergic reactions may occur Hepatitis B virus reactivation: HBV carriers should be monitored during and several months after therapy. If reactivation occurs, Adalimumab should be stopped and antiviral therapy should be started\nDemyelinating disease: Exacerbation or new onset, may occur Cytopenias, pancytopenia: Patients should be advised to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms develop, and should be considered stopping Adalimumab\nHeart failure: Worsening or new onset, may occur\nLupus-like syndrome: Adalimumab should be stopped if syndrome develops",
    "Overdose Effects": "The maximum tolerated dose of Adalimumab has not been established in humans. Multiple doses up to 10 mg/kg have been administered to patients in clinical trials without evidence of dose-limiting toxicities. In case of overdosage, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions or effects and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted immediately.",
