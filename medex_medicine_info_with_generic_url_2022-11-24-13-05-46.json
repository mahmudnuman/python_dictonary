            "Indications": "This is indicated in combination with other antiretrovirals or alone for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection.",
            "Pharmacology": "Abacavir is a carbocyclic synthetic nucleoside analogue and an antiviral agent. Intracellularly, abacavir is converted by cellular enzymes to the active metabolite carbovir triphosphate, an analogue of deoxyguanosine-5'-triphosphate (dGTP). Carbovir triphosphate inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) both by competing with the natural substrate dGTP and by its incorporation into viral DNA. Viral DNA growth is terminated because the incorporated nucleotide lacks a 3'-OH group, which is needed to form the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 phosphodiester linkage essential for DNA chain elongation.Lamivudine is a synthetic nucleoside analogue and is phosphorylated intracellularly to its active 5'-triphosphate metabolite, lamivudine triphosphate (L-TP). This nucleoside analogue is incorporated into viral DNA by HIV reverse transcriptase and HBV polymerase, resulting in DNA chain termination.Zidovudine, a structural analog of thymidine, is a prodrug that must be phosphorylated to its active 5\u2032-triphosphate metabolite, zidovudine triphosphate (ZDV-TP). It inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) via DNA chain termination after incorporation of the nucleotide analogue. It competes with the natural substrate dGTP and incorporates itself into viral DNA. It is also a weak inhibitor of cellular DNA polymerase \u03b1 and \u03b3.",
            "Dosage & Administration": "Recommended dosage for adults and pediatric patients weighing at least 40 kg: The recommended dosage is one tablet taken orally twice daily with or without food. Due to fixed-dose tablet and cannot be dose adjusted, this is not recommended for:\n\nPediatric patients who weigh less than 40 kg.\nPatients with creatinine clearance less than 50 ml/minute\nPatients with mild hepatic impairment.",
            "Interaction": "Abacavir: In a trial of 11 HIV-1-infected subjects receiving methadone-maintenance therapy with 600 mg twice daily (twice the currently recommended dose), oral methadone clearance increased. This alteration will not result in a methadone dose modification in the majority of patients; however, an increased methadone dose may be required in a small number of patients.Lamivudine: Coadministration of single doses of lamivudine and sorbitol resulted in a sorbitol dose-dependent reduction in lamivudine exposures. When possible, avoid use of sorbitol-containing medicines with lamivudine-containing medicinesZidovudine: Concomitant use of zidovudine with the following drugs should be avoided since an antagonistic relationship has been demonstrated in vitro: Stavudine, Doxorubicin, Nucleoside analogues, e.g., ribavirin",
            "Contraindications": "This is contraindicated in patients:\n\nWho have the HLA-B*5701 allele\nWith prior hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, lamivudine, or zidovudine.\nWith moderate or severe hepatic impairment.",

            "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of this preparation in pregnant women. This drug should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefits outweigh the risks. Women infected with HIV should be instructed not to breastfeed due to potential for HIV transmission.",
            "Precautions & Warnings": "Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have occurred with abacavir, a component of this preparation. These hypersensitivity reactions have included multi-organ failure and anaphylaxis and typically occurred within the first 6 weeks of treatment with abacavir (median time to onset was 9 days); although abacavir hypersensitivity reactions have occurred any time during. Patients who carry the HLA-B*5701 allele are at a higher risk of abacavir hypersensitivity reactions; although, patients who do not carry the HLA-B*5701 allele have developed hypersensitivity reactions. Hypersensitivity to abacavir was reported in approximately 206 (8%) of 2,670 patients in 9 clinical trials with abacavir-containing products where HLA-B*5701 screening was not performed. The incidence of suspected abacavir hypersensitivity reactions in clinical trials was 1% when subjects carrying the HLA-B*5701 allele were excluded. In any patient treated with abacavir, the clinical diagnosis of hypersensitivity reaction must remain the basis of clinical decision making.",
            "Overdose Effects": "There is no known specific treatment for overdose with this preparation. If overdose occurs, the patient should be monitored and standard supportive treatment applied as required.",

            "Pharmacology": "Acalabrutinib is a small-molecule inhibitor of BTK. Acalabrutinib and its active metabolite, ACP-5862, form a covalent bond with a cysteine residue in the BTK active site, leading to inhibition of BTK enzymatic activity. BTK is a signaling molecule of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) and cytokine receptor pathways. In B cells, BTK signaling results in activation of pathways necessary for B-cell proliferation, trafficking, chemotaxis, and adhesion.

            "name": "Acarbose",
            "link": "https://medex.com.bd/generics/27/acarbose",
            "Indications": "Acarbose is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2\u00a0diabetes mellitus.",
            "Pharmacology": "In contrast to sulfonylureas, Acarbose\u00a0does not enhance insulin secretion. The antihyperglycemic action of acarbose results from a competitive, reversible inhibition of pancreatic alpha-amylase and membrane-bound intestinal alpha-glucoside hydrolase enzymes. Pancreatic alpha-amylase hydrolyzes complex starches to oligosaccharides in the lumen of the small intestine, while the membrane-bound intestinal alpha-glucosidases hydrolyze oligosaccharides, trisaccharides, and disaccharides to glucose and other monosaccharides in the brush border of the small intestine. In diabetic patients, this enzyme inhibition results in a delayed glucose absorption and a lowering of postprandial hyperglycemia. Because its mechanism of action is different, the effect of Acarbose\u00a0to enhance glycemic control is additive to that of sulfonylureas, insulin or metformin when used in combination. In addition, Acarbose\u00a0diminishes the insulinotropic and weight-increasing effects of sulfonylureas. Acarbose has no inhibitory activity against lactase and consequently would not be expected to induce lactose intolerance.",
            "Dosage & Administration": "The recommended starting dosage of Acarbose\u00a0is 25 mg given orally three times daily at the start (with the first bite) of each main meal. However, some patients may benefit from more gradual dose titration to minimize gastrointestinal side effects. This may be achieved by initiating treatment at 25 mg once per day and subsequently increasing the frequency of administration to achieve 25 mg t.i.d. Maintenance Dosage Once a 25 mg t.i.d. dosage regimen is reached, dosage of Acarbose\u00a0should be adjusted at 4\u20138 week intervals based on one-hour postprandial glucose or glycosylated hemoglobin levels, and on tolerance. The dosage can be increased from 25 mg t.i.d. to 50 mg t.i.d. Some patients may benefit from further increasing the dosage to 100 mg t.i.d. The maintenance dose ranges from 50 mg t.i.d. to 100 mg t.i.d.",
            "Interaction": "Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of blood glucose control. These drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel-blocking drugs, and isoniazid. When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving Acarbose, the patient should be closely observed for loss of blood glucose control. When such drugs are withdrawn from patients receiving Acarbose\u00a0in combination with sulfonylureas or insulin, patients should be observed closely for any evidence of hypoglycemia.Patients Receiving Sulfonylureas or Insulin: Sulfonylurea agents or insulin may cause hypoglycemia. Acarbose\u00a0given in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin may cause a further lowering of blood glucose and may increase the potential for hypoglycemia. If hypoglycemia occurs, appropriate adjustments in the dosage of these agents should be made. Very rarely, individual cases of hypoglycemic shock have been reported in patients receiving Acarbose\u00a0therapy in combination with sulfonylureas and/or insulin.",
            "Contraindications": "Acarbose\u00a0is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug. Precose is contraindicated in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis or cirrhosis. Acarbose\u00a0is also contraindicated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, colonic ulceration, partial intestinal obstruction or in patients predisposed to intestinal obstruction. In addition, Acarbose\u00a0is contraindicated in patients who have chronic intestinal diseases associated with marked disorders of digestion or absorption and in patients who have conditions that may deteriorate as a result of increased gas formation in the intestine.",
            "Side Effects": "Diarrhea, gas, upset stomach, constipation, or stomach pain may occur in the first few weeks of treatment as your body adjusts to this medication but usually improve with time. Follow your prescribed diet to help lessen these side effects. If any of these effects persist or worsen, tell your doctor or pharmacist promptly.",
            "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy Category B. The safety of Acarbose\u00a0in pregnant women has not been established. A small amount of radioactivity has been found in the milk of lactating rats after administration of radiolabeled acarbose. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, Acarbose\u00a0should not be administered to a nursing woman.",
            "Precautions & Warnings": "Because of its mechanism of action, Acarbose when administered alone should not cause hypoglycemia in the fasted or postprandial state. Sulfonylurea agents or insulin may cause hypoglycemia. Because Acarbose given in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin will cause a further lowering of blood glucose, it may increase the potential for hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia does not occur in patients receiving metformin alone under usual circumstances of use, and no increased incidence of hypoglycemia was observed in patients when Acarbose was added to metformin therapy.Oral glucose (dextrose), whose\u00a0absorption\u00a0is not inhibited by Acarbose, should be used instead of sucrose (cane sugar) in the treatment of mild to moderate hypoglycemia. Sucrose, whose hydrolysis to glucose and\u00a0fructose\u00a0is inhibited by Acarbose, is unsuitable for the rapid correction of hypoglycemia. Severe hypoglycemia may require the use of either\u00a0intravenous\u00a0glucose infusion or glucagon injection.",
            "Use in Special Populations": "Pediatric Use: safety and effectiveness of Acarbose\u00a0in pediatric patients have not been established.Geriatric Use: of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of Acarbose\u00a0in the United States, 27% were 65 and over, while 4% were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects.",
            "Overdose Effects": "Unlike sulfonylureas or insulin, an overdose of Acarbose\u00a0will not result in hypoglycemia. An overdose may result in transient increases in flatulence, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort which shortly subside. In cases of overdosage the patient should not be given drinks or meals containing carbohydrates (polysaccharides, oligosaccharides and disaccharides) for the next 4\u20136 hours.",

The mechanism of action of acitretin is unknown, however, evidence exists for a wide range of actions at various cellular and subcellular levels. These include regulation of RNA/DNA synthesis, modulation of factors which influence epidermal proliferation, modification of glycoprotein synthesis and modulation of the immune response. Whatever the exact mechanism of action, the most prominent effect of acitretin is a modulation of cellular differentiation in the epidermis which re-establishes a more normal pattern of cell growth.",
            "Dosage & Administration": "Adult and elderly: Initial daily dose should be 25 mg or 30 mg for 2 to 4 weeks. After this initial treatment period the involved areas of the skin should show a marked response and/or side-effects should be apparent. In general, a daily dosage of 25-50 mg taken for a further 6 to 8 weeks to achieve optimal therapeutic results. However, it may be necessary in some cases to increase the dose up to a maximum of 75 mg/day.In patients with Darier\u2019s disease a starting dose of 10 mg may be appropriate. The dose should be increased cautiously as isomorphic reactions may occur. Patients with severe congenital ichthyosis and severe Darier\u2019s disease may require therapy beyond 3 months. The lowest effective dosage, not exceeding 50mg/day, should be given. Continuous use beyond 6 months is contra-indicated as only limited clinical data are available on patients treated beyond this length of time.Children: The daily dosage is about 0.5mg/kg. Higher doses (up to 1mg/kg daily) may be necessary in some cases for limited periods, but only up to a maximum of 35 mg/day.",
            "Interaction": "Existing data suggests that concurrent intake of acitretin with ethanol led to the formation of etretinate. Concomitant administration of methotrexate, tetracyclines or vitamin A and other retinoids with acitretin is contraindicated. In concurrent treatment with phenytoin, it must be remembered that Acitretin partially reduces the protein binding of phenytoin. Low dose progesterone-only products (minipills) may be an inadequate method of contraception during acitretin therapy, Investigations into the effect of acitretin on the protein binding of anticoagulants of the coumarin type (warfarin) revealed no interaction.",
            "Contraindications": "Acitretin is highly teratogenic and must not be used by women who are pregnant. The same applies to women of childbearing potential unless strict contraception is practiced 4 weeks before, during and for 2 years after treatment. The use of Acitretin is contra-indicated in women who are breast feeding.Acitretin is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic or renal impairment and in patients with chronic abnormally elevated blood lipid values. Concomitant administration of Acitretin with other retinoids or Vitamin A is contra-indicated due to the risk of hypervitaminosis A. Acitretin is contra-indicated in cases of hypersensitivity to the preparation (acitretin or excipients) or to other retinoids. Patients with rare glucose-galactosemalabsorption should not take this medicine.",
            "Side Effects": "Adverse effects are seen in most patients receiving acitretin. Most of the clinical side-effects of Acitretin are dose-related and are usually well-tolerated at the recommended dosages. However, the toxic dose of Acitretin is close to the therapeutic dose and most patients experience some side-effects during theinitial period whilst dosage is being adjusted. The skin and mucous membranes are most commonly affected. An initial worsening of psoriasis symptoms issometimes seen at the beginning of the treatment period.",
            "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Acitretin is contraindicated in pregnant women or nursing mother. It is highly teratogenic. Its use is contraindicated in women who might become pregnant during or within 2 years of the cessation of treatment.",
            "Precautions & Warnings": "The risk of giving birth to a deformed child is exceptionally high if Acitretin is taken before or during pregnancy, no matter for how long or at what dosage. Women of childbearing potential must not receive blood from patients being treated with acitretin. Donation of blood by a patient being treated with acitretin is prohibited during and for two years after completion of treatment with acitretin. The effects of UV light are enhanced by retinoid therapy; therefore patients should avoid excessive exposure to sunlight. Hepatic function should be checked before starting treatment with Acitretin, every 1-2 weeks for the first 2 months after commencement and then every 3 months during treatment. Serum cholesterol and serum triglycerides (fasting values) must be monitored before starting treatment, one month after the commencement and then every 3 months during treatment, especially in high-risk patients and during long-term treatment. Retinoids can alter glucose tolerance, blood sugar levels should therefore be checked. Patients should be warned of the possibility of alopecia. Decreased night vision has been reported with acitretin therapy. Patients with severe headache, nausea, vomiting, and visual disturbances should discontinue acitretin immediately.",
            "Overdose Effects": "Manifestations of acute Vitamin A toxicity include severe headache, vertigo, nausea or vomiting, drowsiness, irritability and pruritus. Signs and symptoms of accidental or deliberate overdosage with Acitretin would probably be similar. Specific treatment is unnecessary because of the low acute toxicity of the preparation.",

            "Indications": "It is indicated for the maintenance treatment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).",
            "Pharmacology": "Aclidinium bromide: Aclidinium bromide is a long-acting anti-muscarinic agent, which is often referred to as an anticholinergic. It has similar affinity to the subtypes of muscarinic receptors M1 to M5. In the airways, it exhibits pharmacological effects through inhibition of M3 receptors at the smooth muscle leading to bronchodilation. The competitive and reversible nature of antagonism was shown with human and animal origin receptors and isolated organ preparations. In preclinical, in vitro as well as in vivo studies, prevention of acetylcholine-induced bronchoconstriction effects was dose-dependent and lasted longer than 24 hours. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. The bronchodilation following inhalation of aclidinium bromide is predominantly a site-specific effect.Formoterol fumarate: Formoterol fumarate is a long-acting selective beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist (LABA) (beta 2-agonist). Inhaled formoterol fumarate acts locally in the lung as a bronchodilator. The pharmacologic effects of beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including formoterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3', 5'-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells.",
            "Dosage & Administration": "For oral inhalation only. Should be taken by revolizer. 400 mcg/12 meg, twice daily (One inhalation capsule in the morning and one in the evening ). Do not take more than one inhalation twice daily.",

To be effective it must be used within a short time of the poisoning occurring, typically an hour. It does not work for poisonings by cyanide, corrosive agents, iron, lithium, alcohols, or malathion. It may be taken by mouth or given by a nasogastric tube. Other uses include inside hemoperfusion machines.",
            "Pharmacology": "Active charcoal binds the poison and prevents its absorption by the gastrointestinal tract. In cases of suspected poisoning, medical personnel administer activated carbon on the scene or at a hospital's emergency department. In rare situations, it may also be used in a hemoperfusion system to remove toxins from the blood stream of poisoned patients. Activated carbon has become the treatment of choice for many poisonings, and other decontamination methods such as ipecac-induced emesis or stomach pumping are now used rarely. It interrupts the enterohepatic and enteroenteric circulation of some drugs/toxins and their metabolites.",

            "Interaction": "Ultracarbon should not be administered together with other drugs because their efficacy can be reduced.",
            "Contraindications": "Febrile diarrhoea. Medicinal charcoal should not be taken in the case of intoxication with corrosive substances (strong acids and alkalis) as this would complicate diagnostic measures eg, oesophagoscopy and gastroscopy.",
            "Side Effects": "As most undesirable effects are based on post-marketing spontaneous reporting, precise frequency estimation is not possible. No adverse reactions to Ultracarbon are known to occur if taken in the recommended dosage to treat the diarrhoea. After very high doses as those taken in intoxications, constipation and intestinal obstruction (mechanical ileus) may occur in individual cases; this can be prevented by administering saline laxatives (eg, sodium sulfate). As medicinal charcoal is excreted in unchanged form, the stools turn black (discoloured faeces) after intake of Ultracarbon tablets.",
            "Pregnancy & Lactation": "No data found",
            "Precautions & Warnings": "Several poisons and drugs require different or additional measures. Medicinal charcoal is not effective in intoxications with organic and inorganic salts as well as solvents eg, for instance, lithium, thallium, cyanide, iron salts, methanol, ethanol and ethylene glycol. Different measures are in these cases indicated to eliminate the poison (eg, gastric lavage).\u00a0In many intoxications, a specific antidote must be administered additionally to medicinal charcoal (eg, acetylcysteine in paracetamol poisoning). To avoid aspiration in unconscious patients, a physician should administer the suspension of Ultracarbon tablets in water by gastric tube.In patients undergoing multiple dose, activated charcoal therapy after intoxication, gastrointestinal sounds should be monitored frequently to assess peristaltic action.Ultracarbon should not be used in cases of poisoning with pesticides.",
            "Overdose Effects": "Activated charcoal is well tolerated and due to its lack of toxicity, overdose requiring treatment is unlikely.

Acyclovir IV Injection when diluted in accordance with the above schedule will give an Acyclovir concentration not greater than 0.5% w/v.Acyclovir IV Injection is known to be compatible with the following infusion fluids and stable for up to 12 hours at room temperature (below 25\u00b0C) when diluted to a concentration not greater than 0.5% w/v Acyclovir.\n\nSodium Chloride Intravenous Infusion BP (0.45% and 0.9% w/v)\nSodium Chloride (0.18% w/v) and Glucose (4% w/v) Intravenous Infusion\nSodium Chloride (0.45% w/v) and Glucose (2.5% w/v) Intravenous Infusion\nCompound Sodium Lactate Intravenous Infusion BP (Hartmann's Solution)\n\r\nAcyclovir IV Injection for Intravenous Infusion contains no preservative. Reconstitution and dilution should therefore be carried out immediately before use and any unused solution should be discarded. The solution should not be refrigerated.",
            "Interaction": "Co-administration of probenecid with Acyclovir has been shown to increase the mean Acyclovir half-life and the area under the concentration time curve. Urinary excretion and renal clearance correspondingly reduced. In patients over 60 years of age concurrent use of diuretics increases plasma levels of Acyclovir very significantly.",
            "Contraindications": "Acyclovir IV Injection is contraindicated in patients known to be hypersensitive to Acyclovir or Valacyclovir.",
            "Side Effects": "Some infrequent adverse reactions are lethargy, obtundation, tremors, confusion, hallucinations, agitation, somnolence, psychosis, convulsions and coma, phlebitis, nausea, vomiting, reversible increases in liver-related enzymes, pruritus, urticaria, rashes, increases in blood urea and creatinine. Local inflammatory reactions may occur if Acyclovir IV Infusion is inadvertently infused into extracellular tissues.",
            "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy category B. There have been no adequate and well controlled studies concerning the safety of Acyclovir in pregnant women. It should not be used during pregnancy unless the benefits to the patient clearly outweigh the potential risks to the fetus. Acyclovir should only be administered to nursing mothers if the benefits to the mother outweigh the potential risks to the baby. There is no experience of the effect of Acyclovir on human fertility.",
            "Precautions & Warnings": "Acyclovir IV injection is intended for intravenous infusion only and should not be used through any other route. Reconstituted Acyclovir IV Infusion has a pH of approximately 11.0 and should not be administered by mouth. Acyclovir IV injection as infusion must be given over a period of at least one hour in order to avoid renal tubular damage. It should not be administered as a bolus injection. Acyclovir IV infusion must be accompanied by adequate hydration. Since maximum urine concentration occurs within the first few hours following infusion, particular attention should be given to establish sufficient urine \u2011ow during that period. Concomitant use of other nephrotoxic drugs, pre-existing renal disease and dehydration increase the risk of further renal impairment by Acyclovir. As Acyclovir has been associated with reversible encephalopathic changes, it should be used with caution in patients with neurological abnormalities, significant hypoxia or serious renal, hepatic or electrolyte abnormalities.",
            "Use in Special Populations": "Pediatric use: The dose of Acyclovir IV injection in children aged 1-12 years should be calculated on the basis of body surface area. Children in this age group with Herpes simplex infections (except Herpes simplex encephalitis) or Varicella zoster infections should be given Acyclovir IV Infusion in doses of 250 mg/m2 (equivalent to 5 mg/kg in adults). Immunocompromised children in this age group with Varicella zoster virus infection or with Herpes simplex encephalitis should be given Acyclovir IV Infusion in doses of 500 mg/m2 (equivalent to 10 mg/kg in adults). Children with impaired renal function require an appropriately modified dose, according to the degree of impairment.\u00a0Geriatric use: No data are available on this age group. However, as creatinine clearance is often low in the elderly, special attention should be given to dosage reduction.In patients with renal impairment:\u00a0Acyclovir should be administered with caution since the drug is excreted through the kidneys. The following modifications in dosage are suggested:\n\nCrCl: 25-50 ml/min: 5 or 10 mg/kg every 12 hours\nCrCl: 10-25 ml/min: 5 or 10 mg/kg every 24 hours\nCrCl: 0-10 ml/min: 2.5 or 5 mg/kg every 24 hours and after dialysis.",
            "Overdose Effects": "Overdosage of intravenous Acyclovir has resulted in elevations of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and subsequent renal failure. Neurological effects including confusion, hallucinations, agitation, seizures and coma have been described in association with over dosage. Adequate hydration is essential to reduce the possibility of crystal formation in the urine. Hemodialysis significantly enhances the removal of Acyclovir from the blood and may, therefore, be considered an option in the management of overdose of Acyclovir.",
            "Therapeutic Class": "Herpes simplex & Varicella-zoster virus infections",
            "Duration of Treatment": "It is recommended that Acyclovir IV Injection for Intravenous Infusion should be administered for five to seven days in the treatment of most infections and for at least ten days in the treatment of Herpes simplex encephalitis.",

            "Pharmacology": "Aciclovir is a synthetic purine derivative. Aciclovir exerts its antiviral effect on Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and Varicella-zoster virus by interfering with DNA synthesis and inhibiting viral replication. In cells infected with herpes virus, the antiviral activity of Aciclovir appears to depend principally on the intracellular conversion of the drug to Aciclovir Triphosphate. Aciclovir is converted to Aciclovir Monophosphate principally via virus coded thymidine kinase; the monophosphate is phosphorylated to the diphosphate via cellular guanylate kinase and then via another cellular enzyme to the triphosphate, which is the pharmacologically active form of the drug. 15-30% of an oral dose of the drug is absorbed from Gl tract. Peak plasma concentrations usually occur within 1.5-2 hours after oral administration. It is widely distributed into body tissues and fluids including the brain, saliva, lungs, liver, muscle, spleen, uterus, vaginal mucosa and secretions, CSF, and herpetic vesicular fluid. Aciclovir is excreted through the kidney by the glomerular filtration & tubular secretion.",

Intracardiac puncture and intramyocardial injection of adrenaline may be effective when external cardiac compression and attempts to restore the circulation by electrical defibrillation or use of a pacemaker ... Read moreAdjunctive use in the management of cardiac arrest. It is used in cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Intracardiac puncture and intramyocardial injection of adrenaline may be effective when external cardiac compression and attempts to restore the circulation by electrical defibrillation or use of a pacemaker fail. Adrenaline is a drug that leads to increased blood pressure, increased heart rate, increased air entry, increased blood glucose, stimulates cardiac activity and reduces allergic reactions by reducing inflammatory response caused by histamine. Due to these properties, it is used for the treatment of allergic and anaphylactic reactions. Adrenaline is the favored treatment for anaphylactic shock and should be administered immediately if a person begins exhibiting severe allergic reactions. Adrenaline is also used in life threatening asthma when failing ventilation and continued deterioration despite nebulizer therapy.",
            "Description": "Adrenaline is a direct-acting sympathomimetic agent exerting its effect on alpha and beta-adrenoceptors. The overall effect of adrenaline depends on the dose, and may be complicated by the homeostatic reflex responses. In resuscitation procedures it is used to increase the efficacy of basic life support. It is a positive cardiac inotrope. Major effects are increased systolic blood pressure by arterioral and venous vasoconstriction (alpha1 effects), reduced diastolic pressure, tachycardia and hyperglycaemia. Adrenaline is rapid in onset and with short duration. After IV infusion the half-life is approximately 5-10 minutes. It is rapidly distributed to the heart, spleen, several glandular tissues and adrenergic nerves. Adrenaline is rapidly metabolised in the liver and tissues by oxidative de-amination and O- methylation followed by reduction or by conjugation with glucuronic acid or sulphate. Up to 90% of the IV dose is excreted in the urine as metabolites. It is approximately 50% bound to plasma proteins.",
            "Pharmacology": "The actions of epinephrine resemble the effects of stimulation of adrenergic nerves. It acts on both alpha and beta receptor sites of sympathetic effector cells. Its most prominent actions are on the beta receptors of the heart, vascular and other smooth muscle. When given by rapid intravenous injection, it produces a rapid rise in blood pressure, mainly systolic, by (1) direct stimulation of cardiac muscle which increases the strength of ventricular contraction, (2) increasing the heart rate and (3) constriction of the arterioles in the skin, mucosa and splanchnic areas of the circulation.When given by slow intravenous injection, epinephrine usually produces only a moderate rise in systolic and a fall in diastolic pressure. Although some increase in pulse pressure occurs, there is usually no great elevation in mean blood pressure. Accordingly, the compensatory reflex mechanisms that come into play with a pronounced increase in blood pressure do not antagonize the direct cardiac actions of epinephrine as much as with catecholamines that have a predominant action on alpha receptors.",
            "Dosage & Administration": "Cardiac arrest:\n\nIntravenous injection: 1 mg injection repeated every 2-3 minutes as necessary.\nEndotracheal: 2-3 mg via an endotracheal tube, repeated as necessary.\nIntracardiac: 0.1 to 1 mg, direct into the atrium of the heart.\nIntraspinal: Usual dose is 0.2 to 0.4 mg added to anesthetic spinal fluid mixture (to prolong anesthetic action by limiting absorption).\n\r\nAnaphylaxis, asthma or severe bronchospasm:\n\nAdult dose is 0.25 0.5 mg. It may be repeated at 5 minutes intervals until perfusion and respiratory status normalizes.\nIn case of dose dilution: 1 mg of Adrenaline to be diluted in 9 ml Normal Saline.\n\nChildren: Initially 10 mcg/kg body weight, not to exceed 250 mcg. May be repeated every 3-5 minutes if necessary. Subsequent doses should be 100 mcg/kg.",
            "Interaction": "Use of Adrenaline with excessive doses of digitalis, mercurial diuretics or other drugs that sensitize the heart to arrhythmias is not recommended. The adverse effects of Adrenaline may be potentiated by tricyclic antidepressants; certain antihistamines; e.g, Diphenhydramine, Tripelennamine, Chlorpheniramine and L-thyroxine Sodium.",
            "Contraindications": "Hypertension, arteriosclerosis, coronary disease and hyperthyroidism. Not to be given to patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors.",
            "Side Effects": "Common side effects are anxiety, restlessness, dizziness, headache, palpitations, rapid pulse, tremors, weakness and coldness of the extremities may be reported even with small doses and especially when given in conjunction with local anaesthetics.",
            "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy Category C. It crosses the placenta and is excreted in breast milk. Adrenaline should only be used in pregnancy if the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the fetus. It is excreted in breast milk and therefore Adrenaline is not recommended for use during lactation because of the risk of adverse effects of infants.",
            "Precautions & Warnings": "The solution should not be used if it is pinkish or darker than slightly yellow or if it contains a precipitate. Adrenaline is readily destroyed by alkalies and oxidizing agents. In the latter category are Oxygen, Chlorine, Iodine, Permanganates, Chromates, Nitrites and salts of easily reducible metals, especially Iron. Adrenaline should not be mixed with Sodium bicarbonate; the solution is oxidised to adrenochrome and then forms polymers. Administer slowly with caution to elderly patients and to patients with ischemic heart disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism or psychoneurosis. Use with extreme caution in patients with long-standing bronchial asthma and emphysema who have developed degenerative heart disease. Anginal pain may be induced when coronary insufficiency is present.",
            "Overdose Effects": "Cardiac arrhythmia leading to ventricular fibrillation, severe hypertension leading to pulmonary edema and cerebral hemorrhage. Combined alpha and beta-adrenergic blocking agents such as Labetalol may counteract the effects of adrenaline, or a beta-blocking agent may be used to treat any supraventricular arrhythmias and Phentolamine to control the alpha-mediated effects on the peripheral circulation.

Read moreEGFR Mutation-Positive, Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Afatinib is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have non-resistant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations as detected by an FDA-approved test.Limitation of Use: The safety and efficacy of Afatinib have not been established in patients whose tumors have resistant EGFR mutations.Previously Treated, Metastatic Squamous NSCLC: Afatinib is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC progressing after platinum-based chemotherapy.",
            "Pharmacology": "Afatinib covalently binds to the kinase domains of EGFR (ErbB1), HER2 (ErbB2), and HER4 (ErbB4) and irreversibly inhibits tyrosine kinase autophosphorylation, resulting in downregulation of ErbB signaling. Certain mutations in EGFR, including non-resistant mutations in its kinase domain, can result in increased autophosphorylation of the receptor, leading to receptor activation, sometimes in the absence of ligand binding, and can support cell proliferation in NSCLC. Non-resistant mutations are defined as those occurring in exons constituting the kinase domain of EGFR that lead to increased receptor activation and where efficacy is predicted by 1) clinically meaningful tumor shrinkage with the recommended dose of afatinib and/or 2) inhibition of cellular proliferation or EGFR tyrosine kinase phosphorylation at concentrations of afatinib sustainable at the recommended dosage according to validated methods. The most commonly found of these mutations are exon 21 L858R substitutions and exon 19 deletions.Afatinib demonstrated inhibition of autophosphorylation and/or in vitro proliferation of cell lines expressing wild type EGFR and in those expressing selected EGFR exon 19 deletion mutations, exon 21 L858R mutations, or other less common non-resistant mutations, at afatinib concentrations achieved in patients. In addition, afatinib inhibited in vitro proliferation of cell lines overexpressing HER2.Treatment with afatinib resulted in inhibition of tumor growth in nude mice implanted with tumors either overexpressing wild type EGFR or HER2 or in an EGFR L858R/T790M double mutant model.",
            "Dosage & Administration": "Patient Selection for Non-Resistant EGFR Mutation-Positive Metastatic NSCLC: Select patients for first line treatment of metastatic NSCLC with Afatinib based on the presence of non-resistant EGFR mutations in tumor specimens.Recommended Dose: The recommended dose of Afatinib is 40 mg orally, once daily until disease progression or no longer tolerated by the patient.Renal impairment: 30 mg orally, once daily in patients with severe renal impairment.Instruct patients to take Afatinib at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal.",
            "Interaction": "Co-administration of P-gp inhibitors can increase afatinib exposure. Reduce Afatinib by 10 mg per day if not tolerated. Co-administration of chronic P-gp inducers orally can decrease afatinib exposure. Increase Afatinib by 10 mg per day as tolerated.",
            "Side Effects": "Most common adverse reactions (\u226520%) were diarrhea, rash/acneiform dermatitis, stomatitis, paronychia, dry skin, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, pruritus.",
            "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, Afatinib can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data on the use of Afatinib in pregnant women. Administration of afatinib to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis at exposures approximately 0.2 times the exposure in humans at the recommended dose of 40 mg daily resulted in embryotoxicity and, in rabbits showing maternal toxicity, increased abortions at late gestational stages [see Data]. Advise a pregnant woman of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.There are no data on the presence of afatinib in human milk or its effects on the breastfed infant or on milk production. Afatinib was present in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Afatinib, advise a lactating woman not to breastfeed during treatment with Afatinib and for 2 weeks after the final dose.",

            "Side Effects": "Most common adverse reactions (all grades, \u226520% incidence and at least 2% greater incidence for the Aflibercept/FOLFIRI regimen) were leukopenia, diarrhea, neutropenia, proteinuria, AST increased, stomatitis, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, ALT increased, hypertension, weight decreased, decreased appetite, epistaxis, abdominal pain, dysphonia, serum creatinine increased, and headache",
            "Pregnancy & Lactation": "Pregnancy category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with Aflibercept in pregnant women. Aflibercept was embryotoxic and teratogenic in rabbits at exposure levels lower than human exposures at the recommended dose, with increased incidences of external, visceral, and skeletal fetal malformations.\u00a0Aflibercept should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.It is not known whether Aflibercept is excreted in human milk.

Monitor elderly patients more closely.\nReversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS): Discontinue Aflibercept.",
            "Use in Special Populations": "Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. In a dose-escalation, safety, and tolerability study, 21 patients ages 2 to 21 years (median age 12.9) with solid tumors received Aflibercept at doses ranging from 2 to 3 mg/kg, IV, every two weeks. The pharmacokinetics of free ziv-aflibercept were evaluated in 8 of these patients (ages 5 to 17 years). The maximum tolerated dose in the study was 2.5 mg/kg, below the dose known to be safe and effective in adults with mCRC.Geriatric Use: Of the 611 patients with mCRC, patients treated with Aflibercept/FOLFIRI, 205 (34%) were 65 years or older, and 33 (5%) were 75 years or older. Elderly patients (\u226565 years of age) experienced higher incidences (\u22655%) of diarrhea, dizziness, asthenia, weight decrease, and dehydration when compared to younger patients. Monitor elderly patients more closely for diarrhea and dehydrationThe effect of Aflibercept on overall survival was similar in patients <65 years old and \u226565 years old who received Aflibercept/FOLFIRI. No dose adjustment of Aflibercept is recommended for patients greater than or equal to 65 years of age.Hepatic Impairment:\u00a0No dedicated clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ziv-aflibercept. Based on a population PK analysis with data from 1507 patients, ziv-aflibercept exposure in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment were similar to those in patients with normal hepatic function. There are no data available for patients with severe hepatic impairment.Renal Impairment: No dedicated clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ziv-aflibercept. Based on a population PK analysis with data from 1507 patients, ziv-aflibercept exposure in patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment were similar to those in patients with normal renal function [see\u00a0Clinical Pharmacology.Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Male and female reproductive function and fertility may be compromised during treatment with Aflibercept, as suggested by findings in monkeys [see\u00a0Nonclinical Toxicology. These animal findings were reversible within 18 weeks after cessation of treatment. Females and males of reproductive potential should use highly effective contraception during and up to a minimum of 3 months after the last dose of treatment.",
            "Overdose Effects": "There have been no cases of overdose reported with Aflibercept. There is no information on the safety of Aflibercept given at doses exceeding 7 mg per kg every 2 weeks or 9 mg per kg every 3 weeks.",

            "Indications": "Agomelatine is indicated for:\n\nMajor depressive disorder especially in non-responders and intolerant to SSRIs\nGeneralized anxiety disorder\nBipolar depression\nSleep disturbances\nSeasonal affective disorder\nMigraine and cluster headaches",
            "Pharmacology": "This compound binds to the melatoninergic receptors and the serotoninergic 5-HT2c receptor giving rise to the Melatonin Agonist and Selective Serotonin Antagonist (MASSA) concept. The melatoninergic receptors MT1 and MT2, are G protein coupled receptors and they act through decreasing cAMP and cGMP. Agomelatine strongly binds to and stimulates the activity of MT1 and MT2 receptors normalizing the disturbed circadian rhythms and disrupted sleep-wake cycles. Unlike the existing antidepressants, agomelatine does not inhibit the uptake of serotonin, norepinephrine or dopamine. It inhibits 5HT-2C receptor (G protein coupled receptor which increases IP3/DAG secondary messenger system) found abundantly in the SCN, frontal cortex, hippocampus and basal ganglia involved in the mood, motor and cognitive deficits associated with depressive states. 5HT-2C receptor antagonism increases norepinephrine and dopamine levels in the frontal cortex of the brain. This action of agomelatine produces antidepressant, antianxiety and also increases slow-wave sleep which is decreased in depression. It has been observed that it can increase neurogenesis in the hippocampus and may also have neuroprotective effects (by influencing glutamate release, glucocorticoid receptor gene expression and various neurotropic factors) which might also contribute to its antidepressant effects. A study has shown that agomelatine alleviates sleep disturbances after one week of therapy and by two weeks antidepressant effects manifest. The combined actions of agomelatine at MT1, MT2, and 5HT-2C receptors can improve the disturbed circadian rhythm and abnormal sleep pattern thus produce the antidepressant effect. These unique effects suggest that it might be effective for the treatment of seasonal affective disorder like anxiety and bipolar depression.",
            "Dosage": "The effective dose of agomelatine is 25 mg per day given once at bed time for two weeks and can be increased to 50 mg per day in patients with inadequate response. Night time dosing is recommended because agomelatine improves the quality of sleep without day time sedation.",
            "Administration": "For oral administration with or without food. Most adult patients should take a dosage of 25 mg (one tablet) daily. It is usually taking prior to bed time. If no improvement is noticed after two weeks, the dosage can be increased to 50 mg (two tablets) daily.",
            "Interaction": "Potential interactions affecting agomelatine:\u00a0Agomelatine is metabolised mainly by cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) (90%) and by CYP2C9 (10%). Medicinal products that interact with these isoenzymes may decrease or increase the bioavailability of agomelatine. Fluvoxamine, a potent CYP1A2 and moderate CYP2C9 inhibitor markedly inhibits the metabolism of agomelatine resulting in a 60-fold (range 12-412) increase of agomelatine exposure. Consequently, co-administration of agomelatine with potent CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g. fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin) is contraindicated.",
            "Contraindications": "It is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment and hypersensitivity to the active substances or any of the excipients.",
            "Side Effects": "The commonly reported adverse effects in the clinical trials of agomelatine are headache, nausea and diarrhea.",

Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see Toxicology: Preclinical Safety Data under Actions). Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. It is not known whether Agomelatine is excreted into human milk. agomelatine or its metabolites are excreted in the milk of lactating rats. Potential effects of agomelatine on the breastfeeding infant have not been established. If treatment with agomelatine is considered necessary, breastfeeding should be discontinued.",
            "Precautions & Warnings": "It is found to increase the level of liver enzymes and so monitoring of enzyme level is warranted before starting therapy and therefore every 6 weeks.",
            "Use in Special Populations": "Children under 18 years: Should be given only on medical advice.Children and adolescents: Agomelatine is not recommended in the treatment of depression in patients .Use in the elderly: Efficacy has not been clearly demonstrated in the elderly (65 years). Only limited clinical data is available on the use of Agomelatine in elderly patients 65 years with major depressive episodes. Therefore, caution should be exercised when prescribing Agomelatine to these patients.",

During the clinical development, there were a few reports of agomelatine overdose, taken alone (up to 450 mg) or in combination (up to 525 mg) with other psychotropic medicinal products. Signs and symptoms of overdose were limited and included drowsiness and epigastralgia. No specific antidotes for agomelatine are known.

It is used in the treatment of intestinal nematode infections and in higher doses in the treatment of hydatid disease. Albendazole exhibits vermicidal, ovicidal, and larvicidal activity. The principal mode of action of Albendazole is its inhibitory effect on tubulin polymerization, which results in the loss of cytoplasmic microtubules.",
            "Pharmacology": "Albendazole is a broad spectrum anthelmintic. Albendazole exhibits vermicidal, ovicidal and larvicidal activities. The drug is thought to exert its anthelmintic effect by blocking glucose uptake in the susceptible helminths, thereby depleting the energy level until it becomes inadequate for survival. Immobilization is followed by the parasite. These events may be a consequence of the binding and subsequent inhibition of parasite tubulin polymerization by Albendazole and its metabolites, although the drug also binds to human tubulin. Albendazole is extensively metabolized, probably in the liver. Albendazole is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but rapidly undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. The principal metabolite albendazole sulphoxide has anthelmintic activity and a plasma half-life of about 8.5 hrs. It is excreted in the urine together with other metabolites.",

Although\u00a0diuresis\u00a0may occur soon after albumin administration has been instituted, best results are obtained if albumin is continued until the normal serum protein level is regained.",
            "Pharmacology": "The main function of albumin results from its contribution to plasma colloid oncotic pressure and transport function. Albumin stabilizes circulating blood volume and carries hormones, enzymes, medicines, and toxins. Other physiological functions include antioxidant properties, free radical scavenging, in addition to maintenance capillary membrane integrity. Exogenously administered albumin increases the oncotic pressure of the intravascular system, moving fluids from the interstitial space, thereby decreasing edema and increasing the circulating blood volume. The increase in volume reduces the concentration and viscosity of blood in patients with decreased circulating blood volume while maintaining cardiac output in shock. In dehydrated patients, negligible effects exist on circulating blood volume. In addition to the above albumin replaces protein in patients with hypoproteinemia until the cause of the deficiency can be determined.This drug has thousands of endogenous and exogenous targets. Human albumin also binds and carries a plethora of hydrophobic molecules, such as endogenous (i.e., cholesterol, fatty acids, bilirubin, thyroxine) or exogenous substances (for example, drugs and toxins), transition metal ions, as well as gas (nitric oxide [NO]), with resulting implications for their solubilisation, transport, metabolism, and detoxification.",
            "Dosage & Administration": "Human albumin 25% is for intravenous administration only. Human albumin may be diluted with 5% glucose or 0.9% sodium chloride. Concentration, dosage, and infusion-rate should be adjusted to the patient\u2019s individual requirements and indication.\n\nHypovolemia: Initial dose 25 g is suggested.\nHypoalbuminemia: 50-75 gm\nPrevention of central volume fluid removed depletion after\nparacentesis due to cirrhotic ascites: 6-8 gm for every 1000 mL of ascitic.\nOHSS: 50 to 100 gm over 4 hours and repeated at 4-12 hour intervals as necessary. 10-50 gm; single infusion.\nARDS: 25 g over 30 minutes and repeated at 8 hours for 3 days if necessary.\nBurns: Determined by direct observation of vital sign or measurement of either plasma oncotic pressure or protein content.\n\nHuman albumin 20%: Measures of adequacy of circulating volume and not plasma albumin levels should be used to determine the dose required. If human albumin is to be administered, haemodynamic performance should be monitored regularly; this may include:\n\narterial blood pressure and pulse rate\ncentral venous pressure\npulmonary artery wedge pressure\nurine output\nelectrolyte\nhaematocrit / haemoglobin\n\r\nThe solution can be directly administered by the intravenous route, or it can be diluted in an isotonic solution (e.g. 0.9% sodium chloride). In plasma exchange the infusion rate should be adjusted to the rate of removal.Human albumin 5%\u00a0may be given intravenously without further dilution. This concentration is approximately isotonic and iso-osmotic with citrated plasma. Albumin (Human) in this concentration provides additional fluid for plasma volume expansion. Therefore, when it is administered to patients with normal blood volume, the rate of infusion should be slow enough to prevent too rapid expansion of plasma volume.In the treatment of shock in an adult patient an initial dose of 500 mL of the 5% albumin solution is given as rapidly as tolerated. If response within 30 minutes is inadequate, an additional 500 mL of 5% albumin solution may be given. The 50 mL dosage form would be appropriate for pediatric use, with a dose of 10-20 mL per kg of body weight infused intravenously at a rate up to 5-10 mL per minute. Therapy should be guided by the clinical response, blood pressure and an assessment of relative anemia. If more than 1000 mL are given, or if hemorrhage has occurred, the administration of packed red blood cells may be desirable.In severe burns, immediate therapy should include large volumes of crystalloid with lesser amounts of 5% albumin solution to maintain an adequate plasma volume. After the first 24 hours, the ratio of albumin to crystalloid may be increased to establish and maintain a plasma albumin level of about 2.5 g/100 mL or a total serum protein level of about 5.2 g/100 mL. However, an optimal regimen for the use of colloids, electrolytes and water after severe burns has not been established.The infusion of Albumin (Human) as a nutrient in the treatment of chronic hypoproteinemia is not recommended. In acute hypoproteinemia, 5% albumin may be used in replacing the protein lost in hypoproteinemic conditions. However, if edema is present or if large amounts of albumin are lost, Albumin (Human) 25% is preferred because of the greater amount of protein in the concentrated solution.

            "Pharmacology": "Alectinib is a highly selective and potent ALK and RET tyrosine kinase inhibitor.In nonclinicalstudies, inhibition of ALK tyrosine kinase activity led to blockage of downstream signaling pathways including STAT 3 and PI3K/AKT and inducedtumor cell death (apoptosis). Alectinib demonstratedin vitroand in vivoactivity against mutant forms of the ALK enzyme, including mutations responsible forresistance to crizotinib.The major metabolite of alectinib (M4) has shown similar in vitropotency and activity. Based on nonclinicaldata, alectinib is not a substrate of p-glycoprotein (P-gp) or breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), which are both efflux transporters in the blood brain barrier, and is therefore able to distribute into and be retained within the central nervous system.

Alectinib and M4 show weak time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4. In vitro, alectinib exhibits a weak induction potential of CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 at clinical concentrations. Results from a clinical drug-drug interaction study in ALK-positive NSCLC patients demonstrated that multiple doses of alectinib had no influence on the exposure of midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A substrate. Therefore, no dose adjustment is required for co-administered CYP3A substrates. Although in vitro studies indicate that alectinib is an inhibitor of CYP2C8, physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling supports that at clinically relevant concentrations alectinib does not have the potential to increase plasma concentrations of co-administered substrates of CYP2C8.",

            "Pharmacology": "Alendronate is a bisphosphonate that binds to bone hydroxyapatite and specifically inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, the bone-resorbing cells. Alendronate reduces bone resorption with no direct effect on bone formation, although the latter process is ultimately reduced because bone resorption and formation are coupled during bone turnover.Animal studies have indicated the following mode of action. At the cellular level, alendronate shows preferential localization to sites of bone resorption, specifically under osteoclasts. The osteoclasts adhere normally to the bone surface but lack the ruffled border that is indicative of active resorption. Alendronate does not interfere with osteoclast recruitment or attachment, but it does inhibit osteoclast activity. Studies in mice on the localization of radioactive [3H] alendronate in bone showed about 10-fold higher uptake on osteoclast surfaces than on osteoblast surfaces. Bones examined 6 and 49 days after [3H] alendronate administration in rats and mice, respectively, showed that normal bone was formed on top of the alendronate, which was incorporated inside the matrix. While incorporated in bone matrix, alendronate is not pharmacologically active. Thus, alendronate must be continuously administered to suppress osteoclasts on newly formed resorption surfaces. Histomorphometry in baboons and rats showed that alendronate treatment reduces bone turnover (i.e., the number of sites at which bone is remodeled). In addition, bone formation exceeds bone resorption at these remodeling sites, leading to progressive gains in bone mass.",

            "Pharmacology": "The first step involved in the activation of vitamin D3 is a 25-hydroxylation which is catalysed by the 25-hydroxylase in the liver and then by other enzymes. The mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase catalyses the first reaction in the oxidation of the side chain of sterol intermediates. The active form of vitamin D3 (calcitriol) binds to intracellular receptors that then function as transcription factors to modulate gene expression. Like the receptors for other steroid hormones and thyroid hormones, the vitamin D receptor has hormone-binding and DNA-binding domains. The vitamin D receptor forms a complex with another intracellular receptor, the retinoid-X receptor, and that heterodimer is what binds to DNA. In most cases studied, the effect is to activate transcription, but situations are also known in which vitamin D suppresses transcription. Calcitriol increases the serum calcium concentrations by: increasing GI absorption of phosphorus and calcium, increasing osteoclastic resorption, and increasing distal renal tubular reabsorption of calcium. Calcitriol appears to promote intestinal absorption of calcium through binding to the vitamin D receptor in the mucosal cytoplasm of the intestine. Subsequently, calcium is absorbed through formation of a calcium-binding protein.",

            "Interaction": "Combinations contra-indicated: Alpha-1-receptor blockers. Combinations to be taken into account: Antihypertensive drugs, nitrates, potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, itraconazole and ritonavir. Repeated 200mg daily dosing of ketoconazole, for seven days resulted in a 2.1-fold increase in Cmax and a 2.5-fold increase in exposure of Alfuzosin Hydrochloride 10mg when administered as a single dose under fed conditions (high fat meal). Other parameters such as tmax and t1/2 were not modified. Cmax and AUC of Alfuzosin Hydrochloride 10mg, when administered as a single dose under fed conditions, increased 2.3- fold and 3.0- fold, respectively following 8-day repeated 400mg ketoconazole daily dosing. The administration of general anaesthetics to patients receiving Alfuzosin Hydrochloride could cause profound hypotension. It is recommended that the tablets be withdrawn 24 hours before surgery.Other forms of interaction:\u00a0No pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic interaction has been observed in healthy volunteers between Alfuzosin Hydrochloride and the following drugs: warfarin, digoxin, hydrochlorothiazide and atenolol.",
            "Contraindications": "As with all alpha-1-blockers in some subjects, in particular patients receiving antihypertensive medications or nitrates, postural hypotension with or without symptoms (dizziness, fatigue, sweating) may develop within a few hours following administration. In such cases, the patient should lie down until the symptoms have completely disappeared. These effects are transient, occur at the beginning of treatment and do not usually prevent the continuation of treatment. The patient should be warned of the possible occurrence of such events. As with all alpha1-receptor blockers, Alfuzosin Hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with acute cardiac failure. Care should be taken when Alfuzosin Hydrochloride is administered to patients who have had a pronounced hypotensive response to another alpha-1-blocker. Treatment should be initiated gradually in patients with hypersensitivity to alpha-1-blockers. Alfuzosin Hydrochloride should be administered carefully to patients being treated with antihypertensives. Blood pressure should be monitored regularly, especially at the beginning of treatment. Patients with congenital QTc prolongation, with a known history of acquired QTc prolongation or who are taking drugs known to increase the QTc interval should be evaluated before and during the administration of Alfuzosin Hydrochloride. In coronary patients, the specific treatment for coronary insufficiency should be continued. If angina pectoris reappears or worsens Alfuzosin Hydrochloride should be discontinued.\u00a0 As there are no clinical safety data available in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30ml/min), Alfuzosin Hydrochloride 10mg prolonged released tablets should not be administered to this patient group. Patients should be warned that the tablet should be swallowed whole. Any other mode of administration, such as crunching, crushing, chewing, grinding or pounding to powder should be prohibited. These actions may lead to inappropriate release and absorption of the drug and therefore possible early adverse reactions. The \u2018Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome\u2019 (IFIS, a variant of small pupil syndrome) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha-1-blockers. Although the risk of this event with Alfuzosin Hydrochloride appears very low, ophthalmic surgeons should be informed in advance of cataract surgery of current or past use of alpha-1-blockers, as IFIS may lead to increased procedural complications. The ophthalmologists should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique. Alfuzosin Hydrochloride 10mg prolonged release tablets contain hydrogenated castor oil which may cause stomach upset and diarrhoea.",

            "Pharmacology": "Extract of Allium cepa: It is derived from the membrane of Allium cepa (onion membrane). It shows antiphlogistic efects through inhibition of infammatory mediators\u2019 secretion and anti-allergenic efect. Extract of Allium cepa inhibits growth of fbroblast of diferent origin, particularly kelloidal fbroblasts. It has also bactericidal efect. While these properties stimulate primary wound healing, it prevents non-physiological scar formation.Heparin: In case of local application, it shows inhibitory efect on fbroblast proliferation. While heparin increases tissue hydration, it reduces irritation resulted from induration and infammation.Allantoin: Allantoin stimulates cellular proliferation. It also supports the development of healthy cells. Allantoin is convenient substance for the treatment of scar through its properties of stimulating epithelization and providing elastic surface formation.Clinical studies:\n\nEvaluation of the use of Extract of Allium cepa, Heparin & Allantoin gel for the prevention of scar formation: Total 1,268 patients were evaluated and after 2 to 3 months of treatment with Extract of Allium cepa, Heparin & Allantoin gel, a reduction of 31.5% in mean scar width and 47.8% reduction of mean scar height at the end of the observation period.\nAssessment of the use of Extract of Allium cepa, Allantoin, and Heparin in the early treatment of C-section scars: A total of 61 females, aged \u226518 years, who had given birth by C-section were evaluated. After six weeks of treatment, the gel showed signifcant improvement of the color, stifness and irregularity of C-section scars.",
            "Dosage & Administration": "This gel should be applied 3-4 times a day to the affected area and massaged gently in order to achieve better penetration. Continue with a circular motion until the gel is completely absorbed. Treatment may take several weeks or months depending on the size of existing scars and contracture.This gel is very safe and its tolerability has been proven in numerous clinical studies.

Read moreAllopurinol is indicated for reducing urate/uric acid formation in conditions where urate/uric acid deposition has already occurred (e.g. gouty arthritis, skin tophi, nephrolithiasis). Allopurinol is indicated for management of 2,8-dihydroxyadenine (2,8-DHA) renal stones related to deficient activity of adenine phospho ribosyltransferase. Allopurinol is indicated for the management of recurrent mixed calcium oxalate renal stones in the presence of hyperuricosuria, when fluid, dietary and similar measures have failed.",
            "Pharmacology": "Allopurinol is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor which is administered orally. It acts on purine catabolism without disrupting the biosynthesis of purines. It reduces the production of uric acid by inhibiting the biochemical reactions immediately preceding its formation. Allopurinol is a structural analogue of the natural purine base, hypoxanthine. It is an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid, the end product of purine metabolism. Allopurinol is approximately 90% absorbed from the GI tract. Peak plasma levels generally occur at 1.5 hours to 4.5 hours. It has a plasma half life of about 1 to 2 hours. Approximately 20% of the ingested Allopurinol is excreted in the faeces.",
            "Dosage & Administration": "Adults: Allopurinol should be introduced at low dosage e.g. 100mg/day to reduce the risk of adverse reactions and increased only if the serum urate response is unsatisfactory. Extra caution should be exercised if renal function is poor. The following dosage schedules are suggested: 100 to 200 mg daily in mild conditions, 300 to 600 mg daily in moderately severe conditions, 700 to 900 mg daily in severe conditions.Children: Children under 15 years: 10 to 20 mg/kg body weight/day up to a maximum of 400 mg daily. Use in children is rarely indicated, except in malignant conditions (especially leukaemia) and certain enzyme disorders such as Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.Elderly: In the absence of specific data, the lowest dosage which produces satisfactory urate reduction should be used.Dosage in renal impairment: In severe renal insufficiency, it may be advisable to use less than 100 mg per day or to use single doses of 100mg\u00a0at longer intervals than one day.",
            "Interaction": "When 6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine is given concurrently with Allopurinol, only one-quarter of the usual dose of 6- mercaptopurine or azathioprine should be given because inhibition of xanthine oxidase will prolong their activity. Evidence suggests that the plasma half-life of vidarabine is increased in the presence of allopurinol. When the two products are used concomitantly extra vigilance is necessary, to recognise enhanced toxic effects. Theophylline levels should be monitored in patients starting or increasing allopurinol therapy. An increase in frequency of skin rash has been reported among patients receiving ampicillin or amoxicillin concurrently with allopurinol compared to patients who are not receiving both drugs. Reports suggest that the plasma concentration of ciclosporin may be increased during concomitant treatment with allopurinol.",
            "Contraindications": "Allopurinol tablet is contra-indicated in patients with\u00a0known hypersensitive to allopurinol.",
            "Side Effects": "Rashes, gastro intestinal disorder\u2019s, rearly malaise, headache,\u00a0vertigo, drowsiness, visual and test disturbances, hypertension, alopecia,\u00a0hepatotoxicity, neuropathy, gynaeconastia and blood disorders.",
            "Pregnancy & Lactation": "There is inadequate evidence of safety of\u00a0Allopurinol in human pregnancy. Use in pregnancy only when there is no\u00a0safer alternative and when the disease itself carries risk for the mother or\u00a0unborn child. There are no data concerning the effects of allopurinol or its\u00a0metabolites on the breast-feed baby.",
            "Precautions & Warnings": "Allopurinol should be withdrawn immediately when a skin rash\u00a0or other evidence of sensitivity occurs. Reduced doses should be used in\u00a0patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Patients under treatment for\u00a0hypertension or cardiac insufficiency may have some concomitant\u00a0impairment of renal function and allopurinol should be used with care in this\u00a0group.",
            "Overdose Effects": "Ingestion of up to 22.5 g allopurinol without adverse effect has been reported. Symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and dizziness have been reported in a patient who ingested 20 gm allopurinol. Adequate hydration to maintain optimum diuresis facilitates excretion of allopurinol and its metabolites. If considered necessary haemodialysis may be used.",
